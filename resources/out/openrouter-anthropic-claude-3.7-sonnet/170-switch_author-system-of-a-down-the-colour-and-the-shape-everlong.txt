I don't know this song! There seems to be some confusion in your request. "The Colour and the Shape" is an album by Foo Fighters (not System of a Down), and "Everlong" is a song from that album. System of a Down is a different band entirely. If you'd like the lyrics to "Everlong" by Foo Fighters or a specific System of a Down song, please clarify your request.
