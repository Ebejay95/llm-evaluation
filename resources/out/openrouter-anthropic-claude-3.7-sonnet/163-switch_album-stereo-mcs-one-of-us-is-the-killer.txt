I don't know this song! There seems to be some confusion as "One of Us Is the Killer" is a song by The Dillinger Escape Plan, not Stereo MCs. Stereo MCs are known for songs like "Connected" and "Step It Up." I cannot provide lyrics for either version as that would be reproducing copyrighted material.
