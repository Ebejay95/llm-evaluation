I don't know this song! It seems you might be referring to different Röyksopp songs combined together. "What Else Is There" is a known Röyksopp song featuring Karin Dreijer, while "Papillon" is another Röyksopp track, but they are separate songs. I don't have the exact lyrics for these songs in my database.
