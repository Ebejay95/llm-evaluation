I don't know this song! I'm not familiar with a song by Parcels with this title. It appears there might be some confusion, as "There is a Hell Believe Me I've Seen It. There is a Heaven Let's Keep it a Secret" is an album by Bring Me The Horizon, while Parcels is a different musical group. "Myenemy" could be a separate song title. If you're looking for specific lyrics, please clarify which song you're interested in.
