I don't know this song! It seems there might be some confusion in your request. "Death Magic" and "Stonefist" don't appear to be Ramones songs from their standard catalog. The Ramones were a punk rock band with songs like "Blitzkrieg Bop" and "I Wanna Be Sedated," but I'm not familiar with a Ramones song called "Death Magic" or "Stonefist."
