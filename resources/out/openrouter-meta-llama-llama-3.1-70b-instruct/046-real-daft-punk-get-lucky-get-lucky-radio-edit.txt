Like the legend of the phoenix
All ends with beginnings
What keeps the planet spinning (uh)
The force of nature
We've come too far
To give up who we are
So let's raise the bar
And our cups to the stars
She's up all night 'til the sun
I'm up all night to get lucky
The present has no ribbon
Your gift keeps on giving
What is this I'm feeling?
If you want to leave I'm ready (ah)
We've come too far
To give up who we are
So let's raise the bar
And our cups to the stars
She's up all night 'til the sun
I'm up all night to get lucky
We're up all night 'til the sun
We're up all night to get lucky
The present has no ribbon
Your gift keeps on giving
What is this I'm feeling?
If you want to leave I'm ready (ah)
We've come too far
To give up who we are
So let's raise the bar
And our cups to the stars
She's up all night 'til the sun
I'm up all night to get lucky
We're up all night 'til the sun
We're up all night to get lucky
