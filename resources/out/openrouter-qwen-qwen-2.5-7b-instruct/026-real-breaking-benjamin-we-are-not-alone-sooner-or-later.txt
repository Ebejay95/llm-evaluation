Sooner or later I'll find my way
To a place where I won't have to hide
I'll be free from the chains that I wear
I'll be free from the lies that I hear

I'll be free from the pain that I bear
I'll be free from the lies that I hear
I'll be free from the pain that I bear
I'll be free from the lies that I hear

I'll be free from the pain that I bear
I'll be free from the lies that I hear
I'll be free from the pain that I bear
I'll be free from the lies that I hear

Sooner or later I'll find my way
To a place where I won't have to hide
I'll be free from the chains that I wear
I'll be free from the lies that I hear
