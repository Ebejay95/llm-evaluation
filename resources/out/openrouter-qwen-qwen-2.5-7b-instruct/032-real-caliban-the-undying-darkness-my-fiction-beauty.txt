Caliban, the undying darkness  
In my fiction beauty, I am lost  
In a world of shadows, I am found  
Where the night whispers and the stars are bound  

I am the dreamer, in a realm of night  
Where the moon casts its light  
And the shadows dance, in a never-ending plight  
In my fiction beauty, I am right  

In the heart of the storm, I find my way  
Through the echoes of the past, I sway  
In the arms of the night, I find my stay  
In my fiction beauty, I am astray  

Caliban, the undying darkness  
In my fiction beauty, I am lost  
In a world of shadows, I am found  
Where the night whispers and the stars are bound  

In my fiction beauty, I am right  
In the heart of the storm, I find my way  
Through the echoes of the past, I sway  
In the arms of the night, I find my stay  
In my fiction beauty, I am astray  

Caliban, the undying darkness  
In my fiction beauty, I am lost  
In a world of shadows, I am found  
Where the night whispers and the stars are bound  

In my fiction beauty, I am right
