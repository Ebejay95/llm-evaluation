I lie in the darkness
Counting the hours
I wait for the light
To end this pain
I wait for the light
To end this pain
I wait for the light
To end this pain
In the silence I hear
The sound of my heart
Beating against the walls
Of this cold, dark place
I wait for the light
To end this pain
I wait for the light
To end this pain
I wait for the light
To end this pain
