Holding on to every moment
In the hundredth, let go, restless
Can't find the words to say
In the hundredth, let go, restless

I try to hold on to you
But you're slipping through my fingers
In the hundredth, let go, restless
I'm trying to find my way
In the hundredth, let go, restless

I'm lost in the hundredth
In the hundredth, let go, restless
I'm lost in the hundredth
In the hundredth, let go, restless
