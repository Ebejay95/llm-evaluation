Midnight Rooms Club,  
Waves of stories, crystal echoes,  
In the silence, we find our way,  
Through the darkness, we play.  

Chorus:  
Oh, we dance under the moonlight,  
Lost in the rhythm, we take flight,  
In this room where time stands still,  
We find our voices, we find our will.  

Bridge:  
Whispers in the wind,  
Secrets in the sound,  
In the midnight rooms, we're found.  

Chorus:  
Oh, we dance under the moonlight,  
Lost in the rhythm, we take flight,  
In this room where time stands still,  
We find our voices, we find our will.  

Outro:  
Waves of stories, crystal echoes,  
In the silence, we find our way,  
Through the darkness, we play.
