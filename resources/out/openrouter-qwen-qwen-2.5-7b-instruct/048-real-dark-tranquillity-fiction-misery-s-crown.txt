Misery's Crown, a crown of thorns, I wear it well
In the dark, I find my way, through the lies and the hell
I am the shadow, I am the light, I am the truth and the lie
In the silence, I hear the screams, of the broken and the dying

Echoes of the past, haunt my mind, like a ghostly choir
In the darkness, I find my strength, in the pain and the fire
I am the architect, of my own demise, in the labyrinthine night
In the ruins, I find my home, in the ashes of the fight

Misery's crown, a crown of thorns, I wear it well
In the dark, I find my way, through the lies and the hell
I am the shadow, I am the light, I am the truth and the lie
In the silence, I hear the screams, of the broken and the dying
