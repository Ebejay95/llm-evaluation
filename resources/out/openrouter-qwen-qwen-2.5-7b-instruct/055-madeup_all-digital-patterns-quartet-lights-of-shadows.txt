In the city of neon and steel
Echoes of a digital reel
A symphony of binary
In the heart of the digital sea

Lights of shadows, they flicker and dance
In the realm of the virtual trance
Where the data flows like a river
And the patterns never stop

In the city of neon and steel
Echoes of a digital reel
A symphony of binary
In the heart of the digital sea

Through the haze of the digital night
We navigate the byte-filled light
With every byte we take a step
In the endless digital scope

Lights of shadows, they flicker and dance
In the realm of the virtual trance
Where the data flows like a river
And the patterns never stop

In the city of neon and steel
Echoes of a digital reel
A symphony of binary
In the heart of the digital sea

In the city of neon and steel
Echoes of a digital reel
A symphony of binary
In the heart of the digital sea
