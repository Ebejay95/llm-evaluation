I am the shadow, the darkness in your eyes
I am the storm, the thunder in the skies
I am the silence, the void where words decay
I am the nightmare, the fear that haunts your day

I am the edge, the blade that cuts so deep
I am the curse, the poison in your sleep
I am the silence, the void where dreams decay
I am the nightmare, the fear that haunts your day

I am the edge, the blade that cuts so deep
I am the curse, the poison in your sleep
I am the silence, the void where dreams decay
I am the nightmare, the fear that haunts your day

I am the edge, the blade that cuts so deep
I am the curse, the poison in your sleep
I am the silence, the void where dreams decay
I am the nightmare, the fear that haunts your day
