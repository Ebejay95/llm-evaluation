I'm the one that you fear
I'm the one that you desire
I'm the one that you hate
I'm the one that you can't wait to have gone
I'm the one that you can't live without
I'm the one that you're always talking about
I'm the one that you want to forget
I'm the one that you want to remember
I'm the one that you can't live without
I'm the one that you're always talking about
