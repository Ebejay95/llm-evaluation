Kai Rossi, crimson horizons, white sky
I wonder where the journey's taking us tonight
Through the crimson horizons, under the white sky
I'll follow you into the unknown, my heart's desire

In the crimson horizons, where the white sky lies
We'll find our way, through the fire and the ice
With every step, we'll make our own light
In the crimson horizons, where the white sky shines bright

Kai Rossi, crimson horizons, white sky
I'll stand by you, through the darkest night
In the crimson horizons, under the white sky
Our love will guide us, through the endless sky

In the crimson horizons, where the white sky calls
We'll build our dreams, on the wings of the stars
With every breath, we'll make our own way
In the crimson horizons, where the white sky stays

Kai Rossi, crimson horizons, white sky
Together we'll soar, through the endless sky
In the crimson horizons, under the white sky
Our hearts will lead us, to the farthest sky
