Behind me lies another fallen soldier  
We must fight through the night  
The battle is not over  
We must fight through the night  
The battle is not over  

Our voices cry out  
But our words are not heard  
Our voices cry out  
But our words are not heard  

We must fight through the night  
The battle is not over  
We must fight through the night  
The battle is not over  

Our voices cry out  
But our words are not heard  
Our voices cry out  
But our words are not heard  

This war is not over  
This war is not over  
This war is not over  
This war is not over
