---  
Buy, beg or steal  
I want your love  
Sister sister, let me in  
Buy, beg or steal  
I want your love  
Sweet salvation, sweet temptation  

I need a fix  
I need a thrill  
I need a taste of your sugar pill  
Sister sister, let me sin  
Take me higher, take me high  
Take me to the other side  

Buy, beg or steal  
I want your love...
