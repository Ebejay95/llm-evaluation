Jesus Christ, that's a pretty face  
The kind you'd find on someone I could save  
If they don't put me away  
Well, it'll be okay  

Do you believe you're missing out?  
That everything good is happening somewhere else?  
But with nobody in your bed  
The night's hard to get through  

And I will die all alone  
And when I arrive I won't know anyone  

Jesus Christ, I'm alone again  
So what did you do those three days you were dead?  
'Cause this problem's gonna last  
More than the weekend  

Well, Jesus Christ, I'm not scared to die  
But I'm a little bit scared of what comes after  
Do I get the gold chariot?  
Do I float through the ceiling?  

Do I divide and fall apart?  
'Cause my bright is too slight to hold back all my dark  

And the ship went down in sight of land  
And in the legend, the waves were walking  
Holding hands with the shallow men  
Whose bright ideas ripped the ground away  

So do you think that we could work out a sign?  
So I'll know it's you and that it's over so I won't even try  

I know you're coming in the night like a thief  
But I've had some time alone to hone my lying technique  
I know you think that I'm someone you can trust  
But I'm scared I'll get scared and I swear I'll try to nail you back up  

So do you think that we could work out a sign?  
So I'll know it's you and that it's over so I won't even try  
I know you're coming for the people like me  
But we all got wood and nails  
And we turn out hate in factories
