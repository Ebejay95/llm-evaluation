[Verse 1]  
Given in death, a life to live  
Given in life, a death to give  
A child is born, a child is dead  
Given in death  

[Chorus]  
Given in death  
Given in death  

[Verse 2]  
Given in life, a death to give  
Given in death, a life to live  
A child is born, a child is dead  
Given in death  

[Chorus]  
Given in death  
Given in death  

[Outro]  
Given in death  
Given in death
