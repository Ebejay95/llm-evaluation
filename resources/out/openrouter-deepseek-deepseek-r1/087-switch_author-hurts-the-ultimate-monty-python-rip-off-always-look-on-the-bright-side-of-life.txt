[Verse 1]  
Some things in life are bad  
They can really make you mad  
Other things just make you swear and curse  
When you're chewing on life's gristle  
Don't grumble, give a whistle  
And this'll help things turn out for the best  

[Chorus]  
And... always look on the bright side of life  
(Whistle)  
Always look on the bright side of life  
(Whistle)  

[Verse 2]  
If life seems jolly rotten  
There's something you've forgotten  
And that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing  
When you're feeling in the dumps  
Don't be silly chumps  
Just purse your lips and whistle  
That's the thing  

[Chorus]  
And... always look on the bright side of life  
(Whistle)  
Always look on the bright side of life  
(Whistle)  

[Outro]  
Come on!  
Life's a piece of shit  
When you look at it  
Life's a laugh and death's a joke, it's true  
You'll see it's all a show  
Keep 'em laughing as you go  
Just remember that the last laugh is on you  

And... always look on the bright side of life  
(Whistle)  
Always look on the bright side of life  
(Whistle)
