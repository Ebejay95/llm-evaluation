Devoid of your mercy  
The endless procession  
You are in the midst of sinners  
Lost in the shadow  

Atonement for all  
Ghost of a man, walking the earth  
Atonement for all  
Ghost of perdition  

In the name of God  
You left me alone  
In the name of God  
You left me alone  

Still clinging to this  
Shroud of lies  
A trail of sickness  
Leading to you  

Atonement for all  
Ghost of a man, walking the earth  
Atonement for all  
Ghost of perdition  

A trail of sickness leading to you  
A trail of sickness leading to you
