[Verse 1]  
Careful, careful, careful...  
I was driving, I was speeding  
I was careful not to go too far  

[Verse 2]  
Careful, careful, careful...  
I was drinking, I was sinking  
I was careful not to show my heart  

[Chorus]  
Careful, careful, careful...  
Careful, careful, careful...  

[Bridge]  
You can’t hide, you can’t hide  
You can’t hide from me  

[Outro]  
Careful, careful, careful...  
Careful, careful, careful...
