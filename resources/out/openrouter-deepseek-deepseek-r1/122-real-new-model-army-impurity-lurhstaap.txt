[Verse 1]  
The sun is going down across the city  
The streets are full of faces  
The city's full of impurity  

[Chorus]  
Impurity  
Impurity  
The ghost of Cain is walking  

[Verse 2]  
The neon lights are burning through the twilight  
The air is full of sirens  
The city's full of impurity  

[Chorus]  
Impurity  
Impurity  
The ghost of Cain is walking  

[Bridge]  
The blood of Abel is crying from the ground  
The mark of Cain is on every face in town  

[Verse 3]  
The sun is gone, the night is here forever  
The streets are full of shadows  
The city's full of impurity  

[Chorus]  
Impurity  
Impurity  
The ghost of Cain is walking  

[Outro]  
Impurity  
Impurity  
The ghost of Cain is walking
