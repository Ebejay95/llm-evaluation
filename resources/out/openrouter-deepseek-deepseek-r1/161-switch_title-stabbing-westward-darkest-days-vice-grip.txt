[Verse 1]  
I can't escape this feeling that's crawling under my skin  
This desperation's got a hold of me again  
I try to fight it but I can't resist the urge  
To let it drag me down into the dirt  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Every time I try to break away  
You pull me back again  

[Chorus]  
Crushing me inside your vice grip  
Holding on until I slip  
Suffocating, I can't breathe  
Trapped inside this misery  

[Verse 2]  
I can't pretend that I don't need this pain  
It's all I have to keep me sane  
I let it in, let it tear me apart  
It's the only thing that numbs my heart  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Every time I try to break away  
You pull me back again  

[Chorus]  
Crushing me inside your vice grip  
Holding on until I slip  
Suffocating, I can't breathe  
Trapped inside this misery  

[Bridge]  
I can't escape, I can't deny  
This is where I choose to die  
Bound by chains I can't untie  
Lost in the chaos in my mind  

[Chorus]  
Crushing me inside your vice grip  
Holding on until I slip  
Suffocating, I can't breathe  
Trapped inside this misery  

[Outro]  
Crushing me inside your vice grip  
Holding on until I slip  
Suffocating, I can't breathe  
Trapped inside this misery
