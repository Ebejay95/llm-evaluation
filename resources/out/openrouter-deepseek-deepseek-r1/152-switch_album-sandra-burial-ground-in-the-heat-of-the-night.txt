**Lyrics for "In the Heat of the Night" by Sandra (1985):**  
*(Note: "Burial Ground" is not a known Sandra song.)*  

In the heat of the night  
Shadows are fallin'  
In the heat of the night  
Love is callin'  

Danger in the air  
Silence everywhere  
Whispers of desire  
Burning like fire  

(Repeat chorus)  

No escape, no place to hide  
In the heat of the night...
