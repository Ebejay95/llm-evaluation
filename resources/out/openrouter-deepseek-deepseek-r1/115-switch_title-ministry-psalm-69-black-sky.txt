Under a black sky  
Blood turns to ice  
Under a black sky  
Your soul turns to ice  

Burn, baby, burn  
Burn, baby, burn  

The air is so thick  
You can cut it with a knife  
The lies that you tell  
They cut like a knife  

Under a black sky  
Your heart is a stone  
Under a black sky  
Your soul is ice  

Burn, baby, burn  
Burn, baby, burn  

You can't escape  
The black sky  
You can't escape  
The black sky  

Burn, baby, burn  
Burn, baby, burn
