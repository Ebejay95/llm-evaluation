[Verse 1]  
The checkpoint's in your cortex, they want it dormant  
The only way to counter this, you keep it swarming  
They want your mind numb, cold, and conforming  
But you gotta visualize the molecular storming  

[Chorus]  
There's a war going on for your mind  
If you're thinking, you're winning  
Resist the war on your mind  
If you're thinking, you're winning  

[Verse 2]  
The airwaves are infected with vague hysteria  
They want you nervous, shook, clutching your terrors  
But truth is not a side effect of your sedative  
So wake up, stay awake, this is not a test, uh  

[Chorus]  
There's a war going on for your mind  
If you're thinking, you're winning  
Resist the war on your mind  
If you're thinking, you're winning  

[Bridge]  
They want your eyes on the screen and your hands on the mouse  
They want you scrolling through reams of self-doubt  
But the revolution won’t be televised, it’ll be digitized  
But the code that breaks the program is in your own eyes  

[Outro]  
Stay human, stay hungry, stay curious, stay free  
The war for your mind’s not fought on your knees  
Stand up, think loud, let your truth be your shield  
In the war for your mind, never yield, never yield
