Death inspires me like a dog inspires a rabbit  
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?  
The windows are slick, the tension is thick  
Yeah, you can cut it with a knife  
I’m jumping on my bike, no, I’m not the same  
Entertain my faith, perform my steps  
I’m a wandering disciple  
I wave my flag, don’t wave the white  

This is not a test, this is the emergency  
This is not a test, this is the emergency  
This is not a test, this is the emergency  
This is not a test, this is the emergency  

Death inspires me like a dog inspires a rabbit  
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?  
The grooves on the face, it speaks of the intent  
Someday, though it might take ninety lives  
But I’ll let it fly, yeah, I’ll let it go  
Entertain my faith, perform my steps  
I’m a wandering disciple  
I wave my flag, don’t wave the white  

This is not a test, this is the emergency  
This is not a test, this is the emergency  
This is not a test, this is the emergency  
This is not a test, this is the emergency  

You’ll have to come and find me  
You’ll have to come and find me  
You’ll have to come and find me  
You’ll have to come and find me  

Death inspires me like a dog inspires a rabbit  
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?  
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?  
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?  
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?
