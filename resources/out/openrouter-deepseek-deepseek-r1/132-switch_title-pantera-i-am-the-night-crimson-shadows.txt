*(Note: Pantera’s "I Am the Night" appears on their 1985 album *I Am the Night*. "Crimson Shadows" is a lyrical phrase in the song, not part of the title. Here are the lyrics as requested:)*  

---  
**I Am the Night**  
I am the night  
Crimson shadows will dance by my side  
I am the night  
I’ll take you through the darkness to the other side  

I am the night  
I am the fear, I am the pain  
I am the night  
I’ll take you through the darkness once again  

The moon is full, the time is right  
To feel the power of the night  
The evil force that burns inside  
Will take you on the deadly ride  

I am the night...
