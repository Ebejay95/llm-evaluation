**Lyrics for "Maybe Memories" by The Used**:  

*I'm alone now, no one's around  
And there's no one to call  
I'm alone now, where should I go?  
No direction at all*  

*Maybe memories are all I have  
Maybe holding on is all I know  
Maybe I'm afraid of what's to come  
Maybe I'm afraid of letting go*  

*I'm alone now, no one's here  
And there's no one to see  
I'm alone now, just me and my fear  
And this pain in me*  

*Maybe memories...*  

*(Repeat chorus)*  

*Letting go... letting go...*  

*(Instrumental break)*  

*Maybe memories...*  

*(Repeat chorus)*  

*Letting go...*  

*(Fade out)*
