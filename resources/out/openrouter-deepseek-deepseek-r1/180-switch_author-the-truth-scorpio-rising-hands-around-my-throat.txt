The truth is a cold, cold kiss  
Scorpio rising  
Death is the sister of sleep  
The sun burns my eyes  

Hands around my throat  
The sun burns my eyes  
Hands around my throat  
The sun burns my eyes  

The truth is a cold, cold kiss  
Scorpio rising  
Death is the sister of sleep  
The sun burns my eyes
