The time bomb ticks, the air is thin  
The walls cave in again  
The static screams, the signal dies  
The broadcast's full of lies  

We're the ones who never quit  
We're the ones who don't exist  
We're the whispers in the trees  
We are the worker bees  

We are the worker bees  
And we're squashed between the vice and disease  
We are the worker bees  
And we're squashed between the vice and disease  

The razor's edge, the paper cut  
The needle and the damage done  
The poison pen, the loaded gun  
The noose for everyone  

We're the ones who never quit  
We're the ones who don't exist  
We're the whispers in the trees  
We are the worker bees  

We are the worker bees  
And we're squashed between the vice and disease  
We are the worker bees  
And we're squashed between the vice and disease  

We are the faded, we are the blame  
We are the reason that you came  
We are the faded, we are the blame  
We are the reason that you came  

We are the worker bees  
And we're squashed between the vice and disease  
We are the worker bees  
And we're squashed between the vice and disease
