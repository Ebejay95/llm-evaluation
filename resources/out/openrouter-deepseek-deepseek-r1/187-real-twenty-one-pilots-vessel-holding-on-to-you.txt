[Verse 1]  
I'm taking over my body, back in control, no more shotty  
I bet a lot of me was lost, "T" is uncrossed and "I"s undotted  
I fought it a lot and it seems a lot like flesh is all I got  
Not anymore, flesh out the door, swat  

[Verse 2]  
Fight it, take the pain, ignite it  
Tie a noose around your mind, loose enough to breathe fine and tie it  
To a tree, tell it, "You belong to me  
This ain't a noose, this is a leash  
And I have news for you, you must obey me"  

[Chorus]  
Holding on to you  
Holding on to you  
Holding on to you  

[Verse 3]  
Entertain my faith  
Lean on my pride  
All of my crimes delegated  
Divide me, I’ll decide  
If it’s time, I’d like to save  
Time is only fading  
Listen to me now  
I’m leaning on this bridge  
Waiting to dissolve  

[Verse 4]  
Look at the stars  
Look how they shine for you  
And everything you do  
Yeah, they were all yellow  
I came along  
I wrote a song for you  
And all the things you do  
And it was called "Yellow"  
So then I took my turn  
Oh, what a thing to have done  
And it was all yellow  

[Outro]  
(Your skin, oh yeah, your skin and bones  
Turn into something beautiful  
Do you know?  
You know I love you so  
You know I love you so)  

[Spoken]  
"I'm holding on to you  
Holding on to you  
Love you so  
I'm holding on to you  
Holding on to you"
