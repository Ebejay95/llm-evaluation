It was me on that road  
But you couldn't see me  
Too much light on my face  
But you couldn't see me  

And where were you when we were  
Why weren't you dancing?  
I wait with patience  
So why weren't you dancing?  

What else is there...  
What else is there...  
What else is there...  
What else is there...  

I tried to call you  
I tried to call you  
But I don't know what else is there  
What else is there...  
What else is there...  
What else is there...  
What else is there...
