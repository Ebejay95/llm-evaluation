I'm too sexy for my shirt  
Too sexy for my shirt  
So sexy it hurts  
And I'm too sexy for Milan  
New York and Japan  
And I'm too sexy for your party  
Too sexy for your party  
No way I'm disco dancing  

I'm a model, you know what I mean  
And I do my little turn on the catwalk  
Yeah, on the catwalk, on the catwalk, yeah  
I do my little turn on the catwalk  

I'm too sexy for my car  
Too sexy for my car  
Too sexy by far  
And I'm too sexy for my hat  
Too sexy for my hat  
What do you think about that?  

I'm a model, you know what I mean  
And I do my little turn on the catwalk  
Yeah, on the catwalk, on the catwalk, yeah  
I shake my little touche on the catwalk  

I'm too sexy for my love  
Too sexy for my love  
Too sexy for my love  
Love's going to leave me  

And I'm too sexy for this song  
Too sexy for this song  
Too sexy for this song  
And I'm a model, you know what I mean  
And I do my little turn on the catwalk  
Yeah, on the catwalk, on the catwalk, yeah  
I shake my little touche on the catwalk  

I'm too sexy, I'm too sexy  
I'm too sexy, yeah  
I'm too sexy, I'm too sexy  
I'm too sexy, yeah  
I'm too sexy for my shirt  
I'm too sexy for my shirt  
Too sexy for this world...
