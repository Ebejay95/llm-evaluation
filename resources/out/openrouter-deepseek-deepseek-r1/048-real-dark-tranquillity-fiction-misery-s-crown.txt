[Verse 1]  
The ever fading perception of our time  
Lost in the circles of tomorrow  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Aching, crawling through the moments  
Reaching for the misery's crown  

[Chorus]  
We are the martyrs, the vagrant ones  
All longing to seize the misery's crown  

[Verse 2]  
A thousand voices calling out my name  
But I just can't hear what they're saying  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Aching, crawling through the moments  
Reaching for the misery's crown  

[Chorus]  
We are the martyrs, the vagrant ones  
All longing to seize the misery's crown  

[Bridge]  
The hollow ways of the unfulfilled  
The shattered hopes reborn  

[Outro]  
We are the martyrs, the vagrant ones  
All longing to seize the misery's crown
