**"Burial Ground" by Stephen Lynch**  
[Intro]  
I'm the caretaker of the cemetery  
I dig the graves and I plant the trees  
I cut the grass and I rake the leaves  
And I bury folks like you!  

[Verse 1]  
Well, I came upon a burial ground  
Late one foggy night  
And there stood a man so gaunt and pale  
I could swear he wasn't right  
He said, "You shouldn't be here, boy  
This place is full of woe  
Now take your living, breathing ass  
And get the hell away from here!"  

[Chorus]  
Burial ground, burial ground  
I'm gonna lay your ass in the burial ground  
Burial ground, burial ground  
I'm gonna lay your ass in the burial ground  

[Verse 2]  
Well, I laughed at him and turned to go  
But he grabbed me by the throat  
He said, "You’ll never leave this place alive  
Now hand me that shovel, I’ll dig your grave!"  

[Chorus]  
Burial ground, burial ground...  

**"Waiting" by Stephen Lynch**  
[Verse 1]  
I’m waiting for my pizza  
I’m waiting for a call  
I’m waiting for my laundry  
I’m waiting for the fall  
I’m waiting for the weekend  
I’m waiting for a sign  
I’m waiting for my ship to come in  
But I think it’s stuck in the brine  

[Chorus]  
I’ve been waiting, waiting, waiting  
Waiting, waiting, waiting for you  
Waiting, waiting, waiting  
What else is there to do?  

[Verse 2]  
I’m waiting for my hair to grow  
I’m waiting for the bus  
I’m waiting for my toast to pop  
I’m waiting for the fuss  
I’m waiting for my coffee  
To cool down just a bit  
I’m waiting for the punchline  
But I think I just missed it  

[Chorus]  
I’ve been waiting, waiting, waiting...  

[Outro]  
Waiting... waiting... waiting...
