"I woke up this morning with a bad hangover  
And my penis was missing again  
This happens all the time  
It's detachable  
...  
I went to the lost and found  
And the lady said, 'Well, we do have a lot of penises here'  
She pulled out this big box  
And I had to try a couple on  
But finally I found one that fit"  

[Repeated chorus:]  
"Detachable penis...  
Detachable penis..."
