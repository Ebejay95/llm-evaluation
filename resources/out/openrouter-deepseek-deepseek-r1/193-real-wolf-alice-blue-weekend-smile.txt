[Verse 1]  
Hey you, dried flowers in your hand  
You’re stood in the gutter with your old mate  
He’s got a knife in his jacket  
But he’s never gonna use it  

[Pre-Chorus]  
I don’t know why you’re looking at me like that  
What you see is what you get  
I am what I am  

[Chorus]  
You can see the glow of my smile in the distance  
I’ve been going through it  
You just see the glow of my smile in the distance  
I’ve been going through it  

[Verse 2]  
Hey you, you think you know me well  
You don’t, you’re just a sucker for the details  
I’m a bad bitch, you don’t like it  
I’m a little freaky, take your pick  

[Pre-Chorus]  
I don’t know why you’re looking at me like that  
What you see is what you get  
I am what I am  

[Chorus]  
You can see the glow of my smile in the distance  
I’ve been going through it  
You just see the glow of my smile in the distance  
I’ve been going through it  

[Bridge]  
If you want to, I can put on a smile  
Make it stay for a while  
If you want to, I can put on a smile  
Make it stay for a while  

[Outro]  
You can see the glow of my smile in the distance  
I’ve been going through it  
You just see the glow of my smile in the distance  
I’ve been going through it
