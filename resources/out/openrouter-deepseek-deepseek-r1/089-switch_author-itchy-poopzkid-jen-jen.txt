[Intro]  
Come on over and do the twist  
Overdo it and have a fit  

[Verse 1]  
Itchy Poopzkid, Jen, Jen, Jen  
Broken, broken, broken, broken, broken, broken, broke  
Broken, broken, broken, broken, broken, broken, broke  

[Chorus]  
She keeps it pumpin' straight to my heart  
She keeps it pumpin' straight to my heart  
She keeps it pumpin' straight to my heart  
She keeps it pumpin' straight to my heart  

[Verse 2]  
Love you so much, it makes me sick  
Even if you don't, you do, even if you don't  
Even if you don't, you do, even if you don't  
Even if you don't, you do, even if you don't  

[Chorus]  
She keeps it pumpin' straight to my heart  
She keeps it pumpin' straight to my heart  
She keeps it pumpin' straight to my heart  
She keeps it pumpin' straight to my heart  

[Outro]  
Beat me outta me  
Beat me outta me  
Beat me outta me  
Beat me outta me  
Beat me outta me  
Beat me outta me  
Beat me outta me  
Beat me outta me
