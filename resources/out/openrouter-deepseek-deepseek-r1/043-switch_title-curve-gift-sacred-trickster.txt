*(from Sonic Youth's album "Rather Ripped", 2006)*  
Hey, you're so cool  
You think you're nobody's fool  
Walking down the street  
Acting like you're so complete  

You think you're so pretty  
You think you're so pretty  
But I think you're shitty

*(from Sonic Youth's album "Washing Machine", 1995)*  
I've got a gift for you  
It's just a song  
It's just a song  
I've got a gift for you

You wanna testify
