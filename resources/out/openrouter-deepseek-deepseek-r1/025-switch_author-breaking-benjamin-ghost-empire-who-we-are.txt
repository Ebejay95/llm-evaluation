[Verse 1]  
We bury our love in the rubble  
We’re falling from grace, we’re in trouble  
We’re chasing the light, but it’s fading  
We’re losing the fight, but we’re waiting  

[Pre-Chorus]  
We’re falling apart, still we carry on  
Tonight we are alive  

[Chorus]  
We’ll carry the war, we’ll carry the flame  
We’ll carry the weight of the world  
We’ll carry the love, we’ll carry the pain  
We’ll carry the ones who can’t carry themselves  
This is who we are  

[Verse 2]  
We’re breaking the chains that divide us  
We’re burning the dark, you can’t hide us  
We’re tearing the truth from the lies  
We’re turning the wrong into right  

[Pre-Chorus]  
We’re falling apart, still we carry on  
Tonight we are alive  

[Chorus]  
We’ll carry the war, we’ll carry the flame  
We’ll carry the weight of the world  
We’ll carry the love, we’ll carry the pain  
We’ll carry the ones who can’t carry themselves  
This is who we are  

[Bridge]  
We’ll carry the war  
We’ll carry the flame  
We’ll carry the weight of the world  
We’ll carry the love  
We’ll carry the pain  
We’ll carry the ones who can’t carry themselves  

[Chorus]  
We’ll carry the war, we’ll carry the flame  
We’ll carry the weight of the world  
We’ll carry the love, we’ll carry the pain  
We’ll carry the ones who can’t carry themselves  
This is who we are
