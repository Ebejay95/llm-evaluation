**Lyrics:**  
Cut the brakes, wild ride  
There's no way I'm changing my mind  
Got to lose this skin I'm trapped within  
History's repeating, and I'm starting to feel  
Like a stranger's hand on my wheel  

Hey, do you want to go  
Steady down on this road?  
Now forget what you know  
This might hurt, I love you so  
Let me go, let me go  

Oh, this is my favourite game  
Oh, this is my favourite game  
Here we go, here we go, here we go again  
Now, this is my favourite game  
Oh, this is my favourite game  
Here we go, here we go, here we go again  

Hear me now, I'm crashing down  
But I'm alone, there's no one around  
If I just turn left, and close my eyes  
Would you care at all? Would you realize?  
All the games we played, they remain  

Hey, do you want to go  
Steady down on this road?  
Now forget what you know  
This might hurt, I love you so  
Let me go, let me go  

Oh, this is my favourite game  
Oh, this is my favourite game  
Here we go, here we go, here we go again  
Now, this is my favourite game  
Oh, this is my favourite game  
Here we go, here we go, here we go again  

There's no reason for a scheme  
Here is what I'm proving:  
There's no way out of here  
I'm choosing to stay  
And you can't make me change  
And you can't make me change  
And you can't make me change  
And you can't make me change  

Oh, this is my favourite game  
Oh, this is my favourite game  
Here we go, here we go, here we go again  
Now, this is my favourite game  
Oh, this is my favourite game  
Here we go, here we go, here we go again
