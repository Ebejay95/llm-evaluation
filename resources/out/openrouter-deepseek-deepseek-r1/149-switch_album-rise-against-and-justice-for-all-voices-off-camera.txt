[Verse 1]  
We walk the plank every night in our sleep  
These maps that we made when the water was deep  
Were once followed but now we ignore  
The paths that they charted, the lines that they bore  

[Verse 2]  
Aimed at our feet as we stand on the shore  
The cannons are loaded, the triggers are pulled  
But the volleys are silent, no bullet or shell  
Just the sound of a wave as it breaks in the swell  

[Chorus]  
So take me away, somewhere far from here  
Let me see your face, let me feel you near  
Take me away from all I've ever known  
To a world we'll call our own  

[Verse 3]  
The tide is now rising, the sand's washed away  
What we built in an hour takes seconds to claim  
But we'll fight the cold current and swim for the ledge  
Where the water won't reach us, where we won't be swept  

[Chorus]  
So take me away, somewhere far from here  
Let me see your face, let me feel you near  
Take me away from all I've ever known  
To a world we'll call our own  

[Bridge]  
We'll dig our own tunnels and burrow our holes  
We'll build our own ladders to climb toward the sun  
We'll string up our wires and set up our poles  
And construct our cities where no one will go  

[Chorus]  
So take me away, somewhere far from here  
Let me see your face, let me feel you near  
Take me away from all I've ever known  
To a world we'll call our own
