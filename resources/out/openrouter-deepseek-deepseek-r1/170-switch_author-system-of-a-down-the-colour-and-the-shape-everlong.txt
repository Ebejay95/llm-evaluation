[Verse 1]  
Hello, I've waited here for you  
Everlong  
Tonight, I throw myself into  
And out of the red, out of her head she sang  

[Chorus]  
Come down and waste away with me  
Down with me  
Slow how, you wanted it to be  
I'm over my head, out of her head she sang  

[Verse 2]  
And I wonder  
When I sing along with you  
If everything could ever feel this real forever  
If anything could ever be this good again  
The only thing I'll ever ask of you  
You've got to promise not to stop when I say when  

[Chorus]  
She sang  

[Bridge]  
Breathe out  
So I can breathe you in  
Hold you in  

[Chorus]  
And I wonder  
When I sing along with you  
If everything could ever feel this real forever  
If anything could ever be this good again  
The only thing I'll ever ask of you  
You've got to promise not to stop when I say when  

[Outro]  
When I say when
