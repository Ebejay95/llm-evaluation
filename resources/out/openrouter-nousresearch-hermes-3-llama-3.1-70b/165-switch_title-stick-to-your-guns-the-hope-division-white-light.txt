[Verse 1]
I'm caught in the crossfire of a world that's gone mad
Where the lines are blurred and the truth is sad
I'm searching for an answer that I know I'll never find
But I won't give up, I won't give in

[Chorus]
I see the white light, and it's guiding me home
Through the darkness and the chaos, it's where I belong
I see the white light, and it's leading me on
To a place where the weary hearts can rest

[Verse 2]
I'm standing on the edge of a world that's gone insane
Where the blind lead the blind and the deaf play the game
I'm screaming at the top of my lungs, but the words fall on deaf ears
But I won't be silenced, I won't be feared

[Chorus]
I see the white light, and it's guiding me home
Through the darkness and the chaos, it's where I belong
I see the white light, and it's leading me on
To a place where the weary hearts can rest

[Bridge]
This is the hope that carries me through
When the weight of the world is on my shoulders
This is the strength that I hold on to
When the light inside me grows colder

[Chorus]
I see the white light, and it's guiding me home
Through the darkness and the chaos, it's where I belong
I see the white light, and it's leading me on
To a place where the weary hearts can rest

[Outro]
I won't be silenced, I won't be feared
I see the white light, and it's guiding me home
I won't give up, I won't give in
I see the white light, and it's leading me on
