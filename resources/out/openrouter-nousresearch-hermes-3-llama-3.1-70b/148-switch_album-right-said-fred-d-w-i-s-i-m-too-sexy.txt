I'm too sexy for my shirt
Too sexy for my shirt
So sexy it hurts
And I'm too sexy for Milan
Too sexy for Milan
And that's the end of the song
I'm too sexy for my car
Too sexy for my car
And if you ask me what I'm wearing
I'd have to say, "Nothing at all"
I'm too sexy for this song
Too sexy for this song
And that's the end of the song
I'm too sexy for my shirt
Too sexy for my shirt
So sexy it hurts
And I'm too sexy for Milan
Too sexy for Milan
And that's the end of the song
I'm too sexy for my car
Too sexy for my car
And if you ask me what I'm wearing
I'd have to say, "Nothing at all"
I'm too sexy for this song
Too sexy for this song
And that's the end of the song
