Here is the lyrics text for "In the End" by Linkin Park from their Hybrid Theory album:

It starts with one thing
I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time

(Chorus)
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It's like I'm paranoid
Am I? So I fly
A million miles away
And I fall
I get knocked down
But I get up again
You're not there for me
'Cause you're not that real

(Chorus)

I put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
It's like I'm locked up in a cage
And I can't break free
And I can't see
The light that's shining
On the other side
It's like I'm knocking on heaven's door
And I can't get in
I'm trapped inside my mind
Wishing that the truth would just be a lie

(Chorus)
