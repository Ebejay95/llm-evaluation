In the year 2525, if man is still alive
If woman can survive, they may find

In the year 3535, ain't gonna need to tell the truth, tell no lies
Everything you think, do, and say, is in the book, your mind is not your own

In the year 4545, you ain't gonna need your eyes
You won't have a point of view, you won't know what to do
You'll just sit in your chair, looking at the screen, you'll be there

In the year 5555, your arms are hanging limp at your sides
Your legs got nothing to do, some machine's doing that for you
In the year 6565, you won't need no hair on your head
You'll have a computer in your arm, you'll be livin' in your pod

In the year 7575, if you're still alive, you're gonna be
In a world that's just black and white and gray
And you'll think back to the days when you were young
And you'll wish you had listened to what we said

Now it's the year 2525, if man is still alive
If woman can survive, they may find

In the year 3535, ain't gonna need to tell the truth, tell no lies
Everything you think, do, and say, is in the book, your mind is not your own

In the year 4545, you ain't gonna need your eyes
You won't have a point of view, you won't know what to do
You'll just sit in your chair, looking at the screen, you'll be there

In the year 5555, your arms are hanging limp at your sides
Your legs got nothing to do, some machine's doing that for you
In the year 6565, you won't need no hair on your head
You'll have a computer in your arm, you'll be livin' in your pod

In the year 7575, if you're still alive, you're gonna be
In a world that's just black and white and gray
And you'll think back to the days when you were young
And you'll wish you had listened to what we said
