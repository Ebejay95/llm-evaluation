Breaking rocks in the hot sun
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won

I needed money 'cause I had none
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won

I left my baby and it feels so bad
Guess my race is run
She's the best girl that I ever had
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won

Robbin' people with a six-gun
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won

I miss my baby and I feel so sad
I guess my race is run
She's the best girl that I ever had
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won
