I'm the one who's been waiting
I'm the one who's been searching for you
I'm the one who's been praying
I'm the one who's been calling your name

You are the rectifier
You are the one who makes me feel alive
You are the rectifier
You are the one who makes me feel so high

I'm the one who's been bleeding
I'm the one who's been crying for you
I'm the one who's been needing
I'm the one who's been dying for you

You are the rectifier
You are the one who makes me feel alive
You are the rectifier
You are the one who makes me feel so high

I'm the one who's been waiting
I'm the one who's been searching for you
I'm the one who's been praying
I'm the one who's been calling your name

You are the rectifier
