For broken words
For silent worlds
We are the ones to blame
For all that we became
For all that we have lost
And all that we have crossed
For all that we have seen

We are the ones to blame
For all that we became
For all that we have lost
And all that we have crossed
For all that we have seen
And all that could have been

For broken words
For silent worlds
We are the ones to blame
For all that we became
For all that we have lost
And all that we have crossed
For all that we have seen
And all that could have been

We are the ones to blame
For all that we became
For all that we have lost
And all that we have crossed
For all that we have seen
And all that could have been
