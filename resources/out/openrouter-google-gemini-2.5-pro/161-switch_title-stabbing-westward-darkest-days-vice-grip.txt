I'm so tired of being afraid
I'm so tired of being ashamed
I'm so tired of being alone
I'm so tired of being at home

I'm so tired of being so tired
I'm so tired of being uninspired
I'm so tired of being in love
I'm so tired of not being enough

I'm so tired of being so weak
I'm so tired I can barely speak
I'm so tired of being so sad
I'm so tired of being so mad

I'm so tired of being so used
I'm so tired of being abused
