I am the darkness, you're the light
I am the left and you're the right
I am the weakness, you're the might
I am the sickness, you're the cure
I am the poison, you're the pure
I am the wicked, you're the sure
I am the ghost, you're the machine

I am the last, you're the first
I am the hunger, you're the thirst
I am the blessed, you're the cursed
I am the future, you're the past
I am the slowest, you're the fast
I am the present, you're the last
I am the ghost, you're the machine

This is who we are
This is who we are

I am the fire, you're the flood
I am the marrow, you're the blood
I am the low, you're the high
I am the future, you
