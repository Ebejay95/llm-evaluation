I'm writing you a letter
From a place you've never been
Where the sky is painted colors
And the night is closing in

The ink is running low now
On this parchment, worn and thin
But my heart is overflowing
With the words I hold within

Oh, aurora, in the distance
Dancing lights of green and blue
You're a beacon in the darkness
And you're pulling me to you

I have traveled over mountains
I have sailed across the sea
Just to witness your existence
Just to feel you close to me

Oh, aurora, in the distance
Dancing lights of green and blue
You're a beacon in the darkness
And you're pulling me to you

And if these words should ever find you
Carried on a northern breeze
Know that I am right behind you
Rustling through the frozen trees

Sincerely,
A lonely traveler
Sincerely,
Yours to keep
