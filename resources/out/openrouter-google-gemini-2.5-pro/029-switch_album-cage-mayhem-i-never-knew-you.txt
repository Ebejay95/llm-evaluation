I never knew you
I only knew the fuckin' hell you put my mother through
And for that I'll never forgive you
I just wish I never lived you
I never knew you
I only knew the fuckin' hell you put my mother through
And for that I'll never forgive you
I just wish I never lived you

I was four years old, a sociopath on a kitchen floor
Chewin' on a Leggo, watchin' you kick in the door
You dragged my mom by the hair, threw her on the couch
And started chokin' her out, I couldn't open my mouth
I'm supposed to be the man of the house, but I'm a little boy
Who just ran in his room to get a little toy
To wave it in your face and hope you'd let her go
But you just backhand my mom and I can't let it go
I'm in the corner of the room with a G.I. Joe
And a lump in my throat that I'm tryin' to swallow
You're screamin' at her, "Look what you made me do!"
And I'm lookin' at you thinkin', "I'm gonna kill you"
I'm not a witness, I'm a victim too
And I've been plottin' on you since '82
