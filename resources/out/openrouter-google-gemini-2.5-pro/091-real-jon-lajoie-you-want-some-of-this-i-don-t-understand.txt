I don't understand
Why girls wear Ugg boots with a mini-skirt
It makes no sense to me
Your feet are hot and your legs are cold
I don't understand
Why guys pop their collars, it's not even cool
You just look like a douchebag
And you're probably a douchebag

I don't understand

I don't understand
Why people poke me on Facebook
What does that even mean?
It's the virtual equivalent of running up to me and tapping me on the shoulder and then running away
I don't understand
Why people say "no offense"
Right before they're about to say something offensive
You're better off just saying the offensive thing
And then saying "I'm sorry, I'm a dick"

I don't understand

I don't understand
Why in movies the bad guy always has to explain his evil plan
Right before he's about to kill the good guy
Just shoot him in the head and then be like "My plan is... oh wait, you're dead"
I don't understand
Why people watch The Hills
It's a show about nothing
It's like the new Seinfeld, except it's not funny and it's not clever

I don't understand
