I ain't no housewife but I gotta keep the house clean
I ain't no mother but I'll make you a meal
I ain't no princess but I'm one for a fairytale
I ain't no damsel but I've been in distress
I ain't no angel but I'm good to the bone
I ain't no preacher but I'll make you a believer
I ain't no doctor but I'll make you feel better
I ain't no rockstar but I'm getting there

I am what I am and I'm good at it
