I've seen the things that I despise become the things that I now am
I've watched my heroes fall and turn to dust
Leaving me behind with this bitter taste
I've seen the things that I despise become the things that I now am
I've watched my heroes fall and turn to dust
Leaving me behind with this bitter taste
I've seen the things that I despise become the things that I now am

I can't escape this whispering silence
But I can choose to embrace it
I can't escape this whispering silence
But I can choose to embrace it

I've seen the things that I despise become the things that I now am
I've watched my heroes fall and turn to dust
Leaving me behind with this bitter taste
I've seen the things that I despise become the things that I now am

I can't escape this whispering silence
But I can choose to embrace it
I can't escape this whispering silence
But I can choose to embrace it

I've seen the things that I despise become the things that I now am
I've watched my heroes fall and turn to dust
Leaving me behind with this bitter taste
I've seen the things that I despise become the things that I now am
