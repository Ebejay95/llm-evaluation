I'm a ghost in the machine
I'm a hole in your TV screen
I'm a glitch in the system
A digital schism
I'm a face in the crowd
I'm a whisper that's spoken too loud
I'm a crack in the pavement
A silent enslavement

This is the song formerly known as
A symbol of the times
A digital ghost in the wires
Fueling all your desires

I'm a bug in the code
An unbearable load
I'm a shadow that follows you home
A feeling you're never alone
I'm the static on the line
A forgotten design
I'm the data you can't erase
Lost in time and space

This is the song formerly known as
A symbol of the times
A digital ghost in the wires
Fueling all your desires

We're all just ones and zeros
Forgotten heroes
In this binary stream
Living out a broken dream

This is the song formerly known as
A symbol of the times
A digital ghost in the wires
Fueling all your desires
