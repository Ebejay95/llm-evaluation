I'm walking on a tightrope
Stretched across a white sky
No ground below, no stars above
Just the pale and endless why

Every step's a whisper
In the silence of the day
Chasing echoes of a memory
That the light has washed away

The sun is a forgotten coin
Lost in a milky sea
And the only shadow that I cast
Is the doubt inside of me

Is this a dream or the waking world?
The lines have blurred and gone
Underneath the canvas of this blank
And blinding, pale white dawn

I reach a hand to touch the haze
It offers no reply
Just the cold and empty promise
Of a lonely, white sky

No color bleeds, no storm will break
Just this suspended breath
A quiet world of nothingness
As peaceful as a death

I keep on walking forward
Though I don't know the way
Hoping for a crack of blue
To break this endless gray

But all I see is white on white
A canvas clean and vast
A future unwritten, a forgotten past
In this moment, built to last.
