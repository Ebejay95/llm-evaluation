Velvet moon, shining bright  
Guiding us through the night  
Catch the wave, let it flow  
Feel the rhythm, let it grow  

Velvet moon, in the sky  
Whispering secrets as we fly  
Catch the wave, ride it high  
Dancing free, we touch the sky  

Velvet moon, soft and clear  
Calling us, drawing near  
Catch the wave, feel the tide  
In this moment, we collide  

Velvet moon, endless glow  
In your light, we let go  
Catch the wave, feel the breeze  
In the night, we find our peace
