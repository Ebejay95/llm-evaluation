(Verse 1)  
Vitja whispers through the trees,  
Echoes hum on midnight breeze.  
Footsteps fade in hollow halls,  
Silence builds its ghostly walls.  

(Chorus)  
Echoes, echoes, calling low,  
Voices lost from long ago.  
Conversations left unsaid,  
Linger like the restless dead.  

(Verse 2)  
Shadows dance in candlelight,  
Flicker soft then take their flight.  
Words dissolve in empty air,  
Leaving only echoes there.  

(Chorus)  
Echoes, echoes, calling low,  
Voices lost from long ago.  
Conversations left unsaid,  
Linger like the restless dead.  

(Bridge)  
Time won’t heal, it only steals,  
Turning truths to phantom reels.  
Vitja hums a broken tune,  
Underneath the watching moon.  

(Outro)  
Echoes fade into the gray,  
Morning chases night away.  
But the whispers never go,  
Just a breath—just a ghost.
