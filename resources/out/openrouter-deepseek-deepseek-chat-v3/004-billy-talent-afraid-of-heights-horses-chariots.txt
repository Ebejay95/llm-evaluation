"Here comes the cavalry, they’re riding in to save the day  
But the horses and the chariots won’t save you from yourself

But the horses and the chariots won’t save you from yourself"  

Afraid of Heights:  
"I’m not afraid of heights, I’m afraid of falling  
I’m not afraid of fights, I’m afraid of losing  
I’m not afraid of nights, I’m afraid of dreaming  
I’m not afraid of lights, I’m afraid of seeing"  

Horses & Chariots:  
"Here comes the cavalry, they’re riding in to save the day  
But the horses and the chariots won’t save you from yourself  
Here comes the cavalry, they’re riding in to save the day  
But the horses and the chariots won’t save you from yourself"
