Here are the lyrics to "Hundreds of Tears" by Sheryl Crow from the *Point Break* soundtrack:

```
Hundreds of tears
I've cried hundreds of tears
For the love that I lost
And the pain that I caused

Hundreds of nights
I've spent hundreds of nights
All alone in my bed
With the ghosts in my head

And I know, yes I know
That the river runs deep
But I'll swim, yes I'll swim
Till I find what I need

Hundreds of miles
I've walked hundreds of miles
Through the wind and the rain
Through the joy and the pain

Hundreds of years
Could pass hundreds of years
But I'll still feel the same
Till you call out my name

And I know, yes I know
That the river runs deep
But I'll swim, yes I'll swim
Till I find what I need

Hundreds of tears
I've cried hundreds of tears
For the love that I lost
And the pain that I caused
```
