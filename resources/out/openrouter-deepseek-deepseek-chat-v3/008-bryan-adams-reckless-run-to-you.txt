Here are the lyrics to "Run to You" by Bryan Adams from the album *Reckless*:

---  
She says her love for me could never die  
But that'd change if she ever found out about you and I  

Oh, but her love is cold  
It wouldn't hurt her if she didn't know  

When it gets too much  
I need to feel your touch  

I'm gonna run to you  
Yeah, I'm gonna run to you  
'Cause when the feeling's right  
I'm gonna stay all night  
I'm gonna run to you  

She's got a heart of gold, she'd never break it  
She'd never hurt me, but I just can't make it  

Oh, but her love is cold  
It wouldn't hurt her if she didn't know  

When it gets too much  
I need to feel your touch  

I'm gonna run to you  
Yeah, I'm gonna run to you  
'Cause when the feeling's right  
I'm gonna stay all night  
I'm gonna run to you  

Oh, but her love is cold  
It wouldn't hurt her if she didn't know  

When it gets too much  
I need to feel your touch  

I'm gonna run to you  
Yeah, I'm gonna run to you  
'Cause when the feeling's right  
I'm gonna stay all night  
I'm gonna run to you  

I'm gonna run to you  
Yeah, I'm gonna run to you  
'Cause when the feeling's right  
I'm gonna stay all night  
I'm gonna run to you  

I'm gonna run to you  
Yeah, I'm gonna run to you  
'Cause when the feeling's right  
I'm gonna stay all night  
I'm gonna run to you
