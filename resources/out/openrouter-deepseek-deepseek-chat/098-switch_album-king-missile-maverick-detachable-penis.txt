I woke up this morning with a bad hangover  
And my penis was missing again.  
This happens all the time.  
It's detachable.  

This comes in handy a lot of the time.  
I can leave it home, when I think it's gonna get me in trouble,  
Or I can rent it out, when I don't need it.  
But now and then I go to a party, get drunk,  
And the next morning I can't for the life of me  
Remember what I did with it.  

First I looked around my apartment, and I couldn't find it.  
So I called up the place where the party was,  
They hadn't seen it either.  
I asked them to check the medicine cabinet  
'Cause for some reason I leave it there sometimes  
But not this time.  

So I told them if it pops up to let me know.  
I called a few people who were at the party,  
But they were no help either.  
I was starting to get desperate.  
I really don't like being without my penis for too long.  
It makes me feel like less of a man,  
And I really hate having to sit down every time I take a leak.  

After a few hours of searching the house,  
And calling everyone I could think of,  
I was starting to get very depressed,  
So I went to the Kiev, and ate breakfast.  
Then, as I walked down Second Avenue towards St. Mark's Place,  
Where all the street people hang out,  
I saw my penis lying on the sidewalk  
I was really excited, but I didn't want him to see me,  
'Cause I knew he'd be really mad at me for losing him again.  

So I snuck up behind him and grabbed him.  
He was very upset.  
He started screaming, "You never take good care of me!"  
And I was like, "Shut up, penis!  
You don't know what I go through!"  

So I took him home, and I washed him off,  
And I put him back on.  
I was really happy for the rest of the day.
