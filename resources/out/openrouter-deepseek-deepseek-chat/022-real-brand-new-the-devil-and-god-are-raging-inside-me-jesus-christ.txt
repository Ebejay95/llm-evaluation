Jesus Christ, that's a pretty face  
The kind you'd find on someone I could save  
If they don't put me away  
Well, it'll be a miracle  

Do you believe you're missing out?  
That everything good is happening somewhere else  
But with nobody in your bed  
The night's hard to get through  

And I will die all alone  
And when I arrive I won't know anyone  

Well, Jesus Christ, I'm alone again  
So what did you do those three days you were dead?  
'Cause this problem's gonna last  
More than the weekend  

Well, Jesus Christ, I'm not scared to die  
I'm a little bit scared of what comes after  
Do I get the gold chariot?  
Do I float through the ceiling?  

Do I divide and fall apart?  
'Cause my bright is too slight to hold back all my dark  
And the ship went down in sight of land  
And at the gates does Thomas ask to see my hands?  

I know you'll come in the night like a thief  
But I've had some time, O Lord, to hone my lying technique  
I know you think that I'm someone you can trust  
But I'm scared I'll get scared and I swear I'll try to nail you back up  

So do you think that we could work out a sign?  
So I'll know it's you and that it's over so I won't even try  
I know you'll come for the people like me  
But we all got wood and nails  
And we turn out hate in factories  

We all got wood and nails  
And we turn out hate in factories  
We all got wood and nails  
And we sleep inside of this machine
