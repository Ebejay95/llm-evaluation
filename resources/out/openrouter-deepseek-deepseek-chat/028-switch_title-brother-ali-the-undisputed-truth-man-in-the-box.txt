Brother Ali - "The Undisputed Truth":
"I was born with the gift of a golden voice  
Twenty-seven years of making noise  
Bearing witness to the struggle and the strife  
Searching for a better way to live my life  
I was taught to fight for what I believe in  
And never let nobody take my freedom  
I was taught to stand up for the weak and the poor  
And never let nobody close my door"

Alice in Chains - "Man in the Box":
"I'm the man in the box  
Buried in my shit  
Won't you come and save me?  
Save me  
Feed my eyes  
Can you sew them shut?  
Jesus Christ, deny your maker  
He who tries, will be wasted  
Feed my eyes, now you've sewn them shut"
