There's a war going on for your mind  
Media mavens mount surgical strikes from trapper keeper collages and parking lot pundits  
With talking points, sensationalize the bottom line  
And the bottom line is this:  
My country, 'tis of thee, sweet land of liability  
Of thee I sing  
Land where my father's pride is buried underground  
Land where the pilgrims' pride is nowhere to be found  
Land of the spied on, home of the lied to  
Conceived in a genocide, and we still believe it  
Land of the thief, home of the slave  
Grand imperial guard where the dollar is sacred and power is God  
There's a war going on for your mind  
If you are thinking, you are winning  
Resistance is victory, defeat is impossible  
Your weapons are already in hand  
Reach within you and find the means by which to gain your freedom  
Fight with tools  
Your fate and your future are hanging in the balance  
And the scales are tipping in your favor
