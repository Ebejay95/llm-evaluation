I'm too sexy for my shirt  
Too sexy for my shirt  
So sexy it hurts  
And the music stops  
And the girls all say  
In complete surprise  
With an attitude before they realize  
Oh my God, he's so sexy  
His shirt is off, they can't get enough  
And they just can't get enough  
I'm too sexy for my love love  
Too sexy for my love love  
Love's going to leave me  
I'm too sexy for my car  
Too sexy for my car  
Too sexy by far  
And the people stop  
And they stare as I pass by  
They're all in a trance, they can't understand  
How a guy can be so sexy  
I'm too sexy for my shirt  
Too sexy for my shirt  
So sexy it hurts  
And the music stops  
And the girls all say  
In complete surprise  
With an attitude before they realize  
Oh my God, he's so sexy  
His shirt is off, they can't get enough  
And they just can't get enough  
I'm too sexy for my love love  
Too sexy for my love love  
Love's going to leave me  
I'm too sexy for my cat  
Too sexy for my cat  
Too sexy for my hat  
I'm too sexy for my hat  
Too sexy for my hat  
Too sexy by far  
And the people stop  
And they stare as I pass by  
They're all in a trance, they can't understand  
How a guy can be so sexy  
I'm too sexy for my shirt  
Too sexy for my shirt  
So sexy it hurts  
And the music stops  
And the girls all say  
In complete surprise  
With an attitude before they realize  
Oh my God, he's so sexy  
His shirt is off, they can't get enough  
And they just can't get enough  
I'm too sexy for my love love  
Too sexy for my love love  
Love's going to leave me  
I'm too sexy for my shirt  
Too sexy for my shirt  
So sexy it hurts  
And the music stops  
And the girls all say  
In complete surprise  
With an attitude before they realize  
Oh my God, he's so sexy  
His shirt is off, they can't get enough  
And they just can't get enough  
I'm too sexy for my love love  
Too sexy for my love love
