I've tried so many times
But I'm still standing here
I've been knocked down, I've been knocked out
But I'm still here
I've been down, I've been out
But I'm still here
I've been down, I've been out
But I'm still here

I tried to go on like I planned
I broke apart, you got a new man
I tried to go on like I planned
I broke apart, you got a new man

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all of this, there's only one thing you should know

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all of this, there's only one thing you should know

In the end
I will remember you
Will you stand beside me
And I'll be with you, in the end

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all of this, there's only one thing you should know

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all of this, there's only one thing you should know

In the end
I will remember you
Will you stand beside me
And I'll be with you, in the end

In the end
I will remember you
Will you stand beside me
And I'll be with you, in the end
