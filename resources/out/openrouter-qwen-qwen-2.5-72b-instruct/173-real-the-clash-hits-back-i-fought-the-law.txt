I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won
I stole some clothes from the cleaner's shop
The law caught up with me and it hurt me bad
They took me in and they locked me up
And they threw away the key
I fought the law and the law won

I got a job on a construction site
But every day was just a fight
The boss would say "Do this, do that"
And I'd say "No, I won't, I don't give a damn"
He called the cops and they came real fast
And they took me to the station
I fought the law and the law won

I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won
I tried to run but I didn't get far
They caught me down by the railroad yard
They put me in the back of a car
And they took me downtown
I fought the law and the law won

I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won
I tried to make a run for the border
But the border was guarded night and day
They caught me in the desert and they threw me in jail
I fought the law and the law won

I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won
