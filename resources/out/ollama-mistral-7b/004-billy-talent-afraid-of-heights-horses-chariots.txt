"I'm afraid of heights, I'm afraid of falling down
I'm afraid of heights, I'm afraid of the ground
I'm afraid of heights, I'm afraid of the sound
I'm afraid of heights, I'm afraid to drown"

"Horses and chariots, they're racing through my mind
Horses and chariots, they're racing through time
They're racing through my dreams, they're racing through my night
Horses and chariots, they're racing with all their might"
