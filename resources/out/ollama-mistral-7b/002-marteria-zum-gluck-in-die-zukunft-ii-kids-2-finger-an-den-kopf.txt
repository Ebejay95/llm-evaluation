"Kids with two fingers on their heads,
Life is a game, we're just playing our parts,
We're the kids with two fingers on our heads.

In the playground of life, we make our own rules,
With dreams in our hearts and no time for fools,
We're the kids with two fingers on our heads.

We don't need a map to find our way,
Just following our hearts, day by day,
We're the kids with two fingers on our heads."
