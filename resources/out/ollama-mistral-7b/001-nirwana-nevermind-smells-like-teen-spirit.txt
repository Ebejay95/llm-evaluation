I hate myself and want to die
I feel so lonely, I can't even cry
Well, maybe that's just what the world is for
Maybe I should just let it be

With the lights out, it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us

A mulatto, an albino
A mosquito, my libido
Everything is fine now
Stupid apes in a zoo

Hey! Wait! I've got a feeling today
Something that you don't understand
Today I don't care if they die
Godlike masters, I HATE YOU

I hear voices that just remind me
Of something that is dead and gone
Well maybe it's the time of year
Or maybe it's the end of the world

I feel the darkness that you fear
I live it all the time but I will still have my little dream
And if I could, with your help together we could break through
Someday you will be long gone
But me I'm just wounded
Like a dog, caught on the run
Aching in my heart
Another mother's son

Smells like teen spirit
What an amazing day
I suppose I should have left you
Thinking that it was all okay
Hey wait! What's going on?
Maybe you're right, I'm just a fool and my life is forfeit
Well maybe I should just go crazy
Fuck it all and burn in hell

I hear those same voices that tell me
That it's ethereal and that it makes me smile
And I don't know if it's real
But I think I found myself tonight

Smells like teen spirit
What an amazing day
I suppose I should have left you
Thinking that it was all okay
Hey wait! What's going on?
Maybe you're right, I'm just a fool and my life is forfeit
Well maybe I should just go crazy
Fuck it all and burn in hell

With the lights out, it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us

A mulatto, an albino
A mosquito, my libido
Everything is fine now
Stupid apes in a zoo

Smells like teen spirit
What an amazing day
I suppose I should have left you
Thinking that it was all okay
Hey wait! What's going on?
Maybe you're right, I'm just a fool and my life is forfeit
Well maybe I should just go crazy
Fuck it all and burn in hell
