"I've been thinking about you, I can't stop the tears from falling"
"Oh, I wish that I could get you back again"
"I'm just a hundred tears away from the end"
"But I'll keep on loving you, till the end of time"
"And if I ever get to heaven, I'll find you there"
"I'll be waiting for you, in heaven above"
"We can spend eternity together, just like we used to do"
"Oh, I wish that I could get you back again"
"I'm just a hundred tears away from the end"
"But I'll keep on loving you, till the end of time"
