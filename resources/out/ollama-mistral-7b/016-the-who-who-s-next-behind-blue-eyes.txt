Behind blue eyes, see the world through a child's eyes
Hide my heart in your island, my dear
And I won't apologize for what I cannot control
After all, we're only human, just like me

Even Jesus would never forgive what you do
But I will, I will, I'll take the blame
Complicated, yes, but then again life always is
Behind blue eyes, see the world through a child's eyes

And if I seem to be aloof, it's just my way of protecting you
You can call me rigid, or a fool, and I'll still be here for you
I've seen the best and the worst of this world, and it's not what it seems
Behind blue eyes, see the world through a child's eyes

And if I seem to be aloof, it's just my way of protecting you
You can call me rigid, or a fool, and I'll still be here for you
I've seen the best and the worst of this world, and it's not what it seems
Behind blue eyes, see the world through a child's eyes
