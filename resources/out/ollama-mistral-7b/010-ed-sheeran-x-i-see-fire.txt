I see flames, like a phoenix rising from the ash
And though I might be cold, I'm still standing tall
I've been living in this world that's been tearing me apart
But now I see the light and it's burning up the dark

The mountain called and I must go
And face the fire 'neath its glowing ember
I cannot stop for cold or weary feet
For I have seen the other side of fear

I've been walking for miles without end
Away from the pain of the life I left behind
But every day's a battle, and the night is so cold
But if I can make it through, I will find gold

The fire burns within me, fuels my very soul
It gives me strength to carry on, no matter how hard it gets
I'll keep moving forward, never looking back
For I have seen the other side of fear

And when the storm comes, and the wind is strong
I'll stand tall and sing a song to drive it along
I'll face whatever comes my way, with courage in my heart
For I have seen the other side of fear.
