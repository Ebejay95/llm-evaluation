"Private Investigations:
I've been working undercover for the FBI
A private investigator, that's what I'll be
I'm on a trail, it's a long and winding road
But I'll be there when the truth is told

Money For Nothing:
Your eyes open wide
You drink that milkshake sky high
And you know that nothing's gonna stop us now

Hey, listen at this dude
Strummin' on his six-string guitar
He sings that song and I like it too
Oh, and he's really a friend of mine
If I could only be like him, wow

I get up when it's time for bed
You canwanna make a million, you can go ahead
Take the money and run, take the money and hide
But there's nothing that you can do, for time is on my side"
