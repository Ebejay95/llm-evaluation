"We've got that nice thang
The effortless cool of mystery
You're up all night for good fun
I feel it coming together

Walking on the edge of glory
And I don't even know your name
But I can't stop thinking 'bout the dance we had
Now I'm hooked and I can't break free

We've got chemistry
I'm hearing that Daft Punk is playing at my house
The effortless cool of mystery
You're up all night for good fun

We've got that nice thang
The effortless cool of mystery
You're up all night for good fun
I feel it coming together"
