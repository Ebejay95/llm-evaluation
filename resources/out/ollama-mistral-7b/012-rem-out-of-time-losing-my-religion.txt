Verse 1:
When the rain starts to pour
I'll swim out the back door
Catch a ride into the city
Your daddy's little girl is missing

Chorus:
I'm going to make a suggestion that she might not understand
I've been losing my religion
Try to tell me who to save, where to send me with a wave of your hand
I've been losing my religion

Verse 2:
It's always been harder than it had to be
You can't start a fire you can't sustain
Now I see through eyes that see too much of your mystery
And it's getting clearer all the time

Chorus:
I'm going to make a suggestion that she might not understand
I've been losing my religion
Try to tell me who to save, where to send me with a wave of your hand
I've been losing my religion

Bridge:
When I think about the road
And I think about the destination
Where everybody wants to go
Out of time, out of time

Verse 3:
I can't live alone, no, I don't want to be
Without you, I need someone bad
Like a heart transplant, got to have your love
I can't help myself, I'm in the thick of it now

Chorus:
I'm going to make a suggestion that she might not understand
I've been losing my religion
Try to tell me who to save, where to send me with a wave of your hand
I've been losing my religion

Outro:
When the rain starts to pour
I'll swim out the back door
Catch a ride into the city
Your daddy's little girl is missing
I'm going to make a suggestion that she might not understand
I've been losing my religion, I've been losing my religion
