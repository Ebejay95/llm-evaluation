"Vitja"
- "In the quiet, I hear your echoes, whispers in the wind, conversations with the stars"

"Echoes"
- "I'm just a voice in the wind, an echo of a memory, fading as time goes by"

"Conversations"
- "We were just two strangers having conversations, under the moonlight, in a world that was ours alone"
