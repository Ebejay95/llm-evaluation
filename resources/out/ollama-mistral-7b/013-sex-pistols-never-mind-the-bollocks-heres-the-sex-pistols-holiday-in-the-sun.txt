Holiday in the sun
Wake up early in the morning
Pack up all my things
I'm going away for a while

Holiday in the sun
I don't need no education
Just to get through the day

Holiday in the sun
Gonna have a good time
Don't want to work or study
Just wanna have some fun

Holiday in the sun
I don't care about tomorrow
I just live for today

Holiday in the sun
I'm gonna find my own way
I don't need no one to tell me what to do

Holiday in the sun
I'm gonna make my own rules
And I'll never let anyone bring me down

Holiday in the sun
I'm gonna live my life my way
And I won't let anyone get in my way.
