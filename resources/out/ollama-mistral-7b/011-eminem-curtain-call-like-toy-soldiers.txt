In the heart of the city where the concrete jungle's cold
Soldiers in the street fighting battles that never get old
We're just like toy soldiers in a war we can't control
Living life on the edge, walking on a wire, hoping it don't fold

In the trenches of the night, where the bullets fly
Everybody's got a story, but nobody cries
I've seen the tears of the innocent fall from their eyes
But I can't feel a thing 'cause I'm just like toy soldiers in a war we can't deny

We're just like toy soldiers in a war we can't control
Living life on the edge, walking on a wire, hoping it don't fold
In the heart of the city where the concrete jungle's cold
Soldiers in the street fighting battles that never get old
