Last Christmas
I gave you my heart, but the very next day
You gave it away to another guy
Tell me how can you do this to me?
Tell me how can you be happy just like you were?

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart, but the very next day
You gave it away to another guy
Tell me how can you do this to me?
Tell me how can you be happy just like you were?

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart, set fire to the dark
Now in my dreams, I'm melting with the sun
Sending all my love from the cold and grey London town
Hoping that you find it when you're looking down

I gave you my heart, but the very next day
You gave it away to another guy
Tell me how can you do this to me?
Tell me how can you be happy just like you were?
