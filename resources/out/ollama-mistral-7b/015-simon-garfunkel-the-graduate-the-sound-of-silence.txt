And the sound of silence will drive them crazy
They're talking 'bout the real silent treatment
Adding to the list they got a name for you, Mr. Tambourine Man
But son, you're gonna carry that weight
A heartache to remember
We've gone and wasted time
And I can't make it right, I can't make it right
I can't make it right, I can't make it right
When a man is troubled and he feels he got to be hard
He's gonna have to decide
Whether to be soft or to be harsh
And if a woman is feeling too proud of her charms
She should leave the window open just a little bit wide
There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to heaven
When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for
Oh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven
There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a forest of pine, we'll walk with our hands tied
And hopefully we'll find a way
But I'd trade all my tomorrows for a single yesterday
To be able to feel that I could make a difference
Yesterday, yesterday
