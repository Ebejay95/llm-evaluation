"Money for nothing
I watch you shower, I just got time for a soda
And your bodies glowing in the dark
Well the night has a face and she is very young
She's a wicked, wicked girl, scary-cary

Got my mind set on a hundred dollar bill
That's what I want, what I really, really want
But all I got is this lousy job in a coal mine
Gotta pay my dues, if I ever hope to get out of here

My nose starts bleeding every time I think about it
Sendin' out an SOS to the real world
I could be homeward bound, but I'd rather spend my days
Driving around in my car reliving old days

Money for nothing, chicks for free
Now that's what I want, yeah, that's what I want
But all I got is this lousy job in a coal mine
Gotta pay my dues, if I ever hope to get out of here

Oh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on
I wish I had a river I could skate away on
I wish I had a river I could skate away on
I wish I had a river I could skate away on"
