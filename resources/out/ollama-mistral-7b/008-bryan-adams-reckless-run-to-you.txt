Run to you
When I need you, run to me
Run to you, when I'm in need
I'll be there for you, just like a heartbeat

Run to you
When the night is cold and lonely
Run to you, when I'm in pain
I'll be there for you, until the end of time

Run to you
When the world around us crumbles
Run to you, when I need a friend
I'll be there for you, till the day I die

Run to you
When my heart is filled with sorrow
Run to you, when I'm feeling low
I'll be there for you, like a guiding star above

Run to you
When the darkness starts to gather
Run to you, when I need some light
I'll be there for you, till the morning comes

Run to you
When the storm is raging hard
Run to you, when I'm feeling lost
I'll be there for you, like a shelter from the storm

Run to you
When the world seems out of reach
Run to you, when I need some peace
I'll be there for you, till the end of time.
