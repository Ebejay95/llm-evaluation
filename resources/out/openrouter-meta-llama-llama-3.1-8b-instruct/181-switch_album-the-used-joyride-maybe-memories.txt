In the dark of the night, I hear your voice whisper my name 
You're the ghost that I've been chasing 
You're the fire that I've been escaping 
You're the one that I've been running from 

I'm running from the ghosts that I've made 
I'm running from the demons in my head 
I'm running from the memories that I've made 
I'm running from the love that I've been given 

I'm running from the ghosts that I've made 
I'm running from the demons in my head 
I'm running from the memories that I've made 
I'm running from the love that I've been given
