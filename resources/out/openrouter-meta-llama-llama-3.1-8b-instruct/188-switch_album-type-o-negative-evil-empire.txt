In the dark of the night, I see your face
A vision of beauty, a wicked, wicked place
Where the damned and the lost, they all reside
And the darkness is deep, and the shadows abide

In the evil empire, where the damned souls roam
I see your face, and I am not at home
In the evil empire, where the damned souls roam
I see your face, and I am not at home

You're a wicked, wicked thing, a wicked, wicked girl
You're a wicked, wicked thing, a wicked, wicked girl

In the evil empire, where the damned souls roam
I see your face, and I am not at home
In the evil empire, where the damned souls roam
I see your face, and I am not at home

You're a wicked, wicked thing, a wicked, wicked girl
You're a wicked, wicked thing, a wicked, wicked girl
