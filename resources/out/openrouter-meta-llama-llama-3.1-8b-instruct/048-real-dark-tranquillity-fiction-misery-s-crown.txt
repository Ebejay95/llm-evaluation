In the dark of night, I see your face 
A fleeting glimpse of a distant place 
A memory that I've yet to find 
A moment lost in time 

In the dark of night, I hear your voice 
A whisper in the silence, a haunting choice 
A call to follow, a path unseen 
A journey through the shadows, where the lost are seen 

In the dark of night, I feel your pain 
A reflection of the sorrow that remains 
A reminder of the love that's lost 
A heart that's broken, forever crossed 

In the dark of night, I see your eyes 
A window to the soul, a glimpse of surprise 
A moment's peace, a lifetime's strife 
A love that's lost, a heart that's rife 

In the dark of night, I hear your voice 
A whisper in the silence, a haunting choice 
A call to follow, a path unseen 
A journey through the shadows, where the lost are seen
