In the dark of the night, I'm searching for a light 
A fleeting glimpse of hope, a beacon in the fight 
I'm reaching out for a hand, to guide me through the pain 
A desperate cry, a heart that's lost its way 

I'm writing letters home, to the one I love 
Hoping that they'll find me, and send me from above 
A message in a bottle, a cry for help 
A desperate attempt, to break the shell 

I'm searching for a way, to escape this place 
A world that's full of hate, a world that's lost its face 
I'm reaching out for a hand, to guide me through the night 
A desperate cry, a heart that's lost its light 

I'm writing letters home, to the one I love 
Hoping that they'll find me, and send me from above 
A message in a bottle, a cry for help 
A desperate attempt, to break the shell
