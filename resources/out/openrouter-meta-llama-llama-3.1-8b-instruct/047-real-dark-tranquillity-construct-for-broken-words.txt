In the silence I hear your voice 
A whispered promise, a heartfelt choice 
To follow me, to follow me 
Where the darkness calls, I'll be free 

In the silence I hear your voice 
A whispered promise, a heartfelt choice 
To follow me, to follow me 
Where the darkness calls, I'll be free 

In the silence I hear your voice 
A whispered promise, a heartfelt choice 
To follow me, to follow me 
Where the darkness calls, I'll be free
