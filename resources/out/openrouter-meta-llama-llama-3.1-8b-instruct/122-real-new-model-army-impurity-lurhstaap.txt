In the dark of the city, where the streets are cold and grey 
The shadows hide the faces, of those who'd rather not play 
The game of life, where the stakes are high 
And the losers are the ones, who can't deny 

The weight of the world, is crushing me 
I'm searching for a way, to break free 
From the chains that bind me, to the lies that I've been told 
I'm searching for a truth, that's yet to be unfold 

In the dark of the night, where the stars are few 
I'm searching for a light, to guide me through 
The darkness that surrounds me, the fear that I've been told 
I'm searching for a way, to break the mold
