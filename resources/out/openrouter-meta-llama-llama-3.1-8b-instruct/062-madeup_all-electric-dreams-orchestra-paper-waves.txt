In the silence, I hear your voice 
Whispers in the dark of night 
A gentle breeze that stirs the foam 
A lonely wave that crashes home 

In the stillness, I feel your hand 
A guiding force that takes me far 
To places where the heart can stand 
And the soul can travel who we are 

In the quiet, I see your face 
A vision of a love so true 
A reflection of a secret place 
Where the heart and soul can renew 

In the calm, I hear your song 
A melody that echoes deep 
A harmony that lasts all day long 
A love that in my heart will keep
