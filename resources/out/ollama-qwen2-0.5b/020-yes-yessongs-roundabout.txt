Verse 1:
I'm in this roundabout, I don't know what to do
But I'll keep on going, till I find my way
I've been here before, but it's time for me to leave
And start a new chapter of life

Chorus:
Roundabout, roundabout, I'm still here
It's time to make a change, and let's go
We're all in this together, we'll never be alone
But we won't always have the same answers

Verse 2:
I've been through so much, but I'm not ready to give up
And I know what it takes to get where I want to be
I've got a plan, and I'm going to follow it
With all my heart, I'll make this new journey

Chorus:
Roundabout, roundabout, I'm still here
It's time to make a change, and let's go
We're all in this together, we'll never be alone
But we won't always have the same answers

Bridge:
I've learned so much, but I know that it takes time
To grow up and become the person you want to be
And I'm ready for what life has in store for me
With every step, with each new day

Chorus:
Roundabout, roundabout, I'm still here
It's time to make a change, and let's go
We're all in this together, we'll never be alone
But we won't always have the same answers
