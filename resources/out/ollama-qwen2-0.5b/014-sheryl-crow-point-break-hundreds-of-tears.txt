I'm standing here with my guitar in hand
And I wanna make a difference
I wanna be heard, not just seen
But I'll do it, cause I believe

Cause you're the one that matters
You're the one that's got me feeling
I wanna break free from this pain
And let's go on to the next chapter

Verse 2:
Point Break, hundreds of tears
The pain is still there, but I'll fight it
I'm not going to let it take over
I'm gonna make a difference, cause I believe

Chorus:
Cause you're the one that matters
You're the one that's got me feeling
I wanna break free from this pain
And let's go on to the next chapter

Bridge:
But sometimes, life gets tough
And we have to take care of ourselves
We need to be kind and gentle
To each other, cause it's okay

Chorus:
Cause you're the one that matters
You're the one that's got me feeling
I wanna break free from this pain
And let's go on to the next chapter
