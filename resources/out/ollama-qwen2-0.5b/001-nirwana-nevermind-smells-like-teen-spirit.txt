Verse 1:
I'm in Nirwana, never mind, Smells like teen spirit
It's a mix of rock and roll, with a dash of hip-hop
The beat is heavy, the guitar sounds loud
And the crowd is always on the move

Chorus:
Nirwana, Nevermind, Smells like teen spirit
It's a mix of rock and roll, with a dash of hip-hop
The beat is heavy, the guitar sounds loud
And the crowd is always on the move
