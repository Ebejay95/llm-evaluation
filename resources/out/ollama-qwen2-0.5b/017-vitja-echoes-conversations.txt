Verse 1:
I was lost in my thoughts, I couldn't find my way
But then I heard a voice, it's me again
Echoes of the past, conversations with you

Chorus:
You were there for me when I needed to be
And now I'm here for you too
Conversations we've had, they're still fresh
In your heart and in my mind

Verse 2:
I'll never forget what you said, it's like a song
That will always play in my head
Echoes of the past, conversations with you

Chorus:
You were there for me when I needed to be
And now I'm here for you too
Conversations we've had, they're still fresh
In your heart and in my mind

Bridge:
I'll never forget what you said, it's like a song
That will always play in my head
Echoes of the past, conversations with you

Chorus:
You were there for me when I needed to be
And now I'm here for you too
Conversations we've had, they're still fresh
In your heart and in my mind
