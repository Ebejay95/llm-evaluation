Verse 1:
I'm on the river, I'm in the water,
Catch the wave, catch the wave.
It's a beautiful sight, it's a sight to see.
The waves are crashing down, they're coming up.

Chorus:
Catch the wave, catch the wave,
It's a beautiful sight, it's a sight to see.
The waves are crashing down, they're coming up.
Catch the wave, catch the wave.
