"Like Toy Soldiers"
I'm not sure if it's just me or this song, but Eminem seems to be singing about a similar feeling to "Toy Soldiers". The lyrics are:
"I'm not sure if it's just me or this song, but Eminem seems to be singing about a similar feeling to "Toy Soldiers".
The first line is "I'm not sure if it's just me or this song, but Eminem seems to be singing about a similar feeling to "Toy Soldiers"". The second line is "Like toy soldiers, I don't know what they do/But I'm here for you like a toy soldier."
