I'm a wandering letter
Looking for a line
I'm a ghost of love
In an envelope of pine

I drift from door to door
Looking for a home
I'm a wandering letter
Forever left to roam

I've got no place to rest
I've got no quiet nest
I'm a wandering letter
Looking for an address

I've got a heart that's broke
A message in a smoke
I'm a wandering letter
A love note that you wrote

I've got no place to rest
I've got no quiet nest
I'm a wandering letter
Looking for an address
