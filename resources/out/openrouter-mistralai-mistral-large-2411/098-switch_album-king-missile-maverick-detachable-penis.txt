I woke up this morning with a bad hangover
And my penis was missing again
Just like the last time and the time before that
It was just after my friend's bachelor party

This can't keep happening, I told myself
I've got to sit down and have a long talk with my penis
I said, penis, this can't keep happening

He said, look, it's not that big a deal
You go to sleep, I go out, I have a few drinks
I meet a few girls, don't wait up

So I talked to my psychiatrist
He said I was suffering from
Detachable Penis, a new psychological disorder
Afflicting men of the '90s

He gave me a prescription
For an experimental drug
I took the prescription to the pharmacist
He said, Detachable Penis? What's that?

I said, that's a new psychological disorder
Afflicting men of the '90s
He said, Detachable Penis is not covered by insurance
It's considered a pre-existing condition

I said look, I have a prescription
I have no money, but I have no penis
And I can't fuck

He said, I see, in that case, I'll make an exception
I got the pills, took a taxi home
I took off my clothes, laid down on my bed
I took one of the pills, and waited

And waited, looked down, nothing
I took another pill, waited
Looked down, nothing

I took the rest of the pills
My phone started ringing
Picked it up, it was my penis

He said, hey, how's it going?
I said, I took those pills, I'm fucking dying
He said, hey, I'm just checking in
Don't get mad, I'll see you in the morning
Hung up the phone, passed out, woke up in the morning

My penis was home, everything was back to normal
I turned on the radio
A talk show was on, the host said,

Our guest today is an expert on psychological disorders
Of men in the '90s
His new book, Detachable Penis,
A Self-Help Guide For The '90s, is in bookstores now

I turned off the radio and went to see my psychiatrist
I said, my penis is home, the drugs aren't working
He said, I think we should try shock therapy

I said, no, I don't have any money left
He said, don't worry, we'll find a way
I walked out, the room started shaking
My knees began to buckle

My penis fell right off my body, again
Looked down, saw it crawling away
I started chasing it, it dodged behind a tree
I lost it, I pushed the tree over

I saw my penis about 20 yards away
Lying in a ditch, I started walking towards it
It jumped out of the ditch
It started taunting me, waving at me

I started running after it
It let me get close, then it took off
I kept chasing it, it ran up a hill
I saw it go into a cave, I went in after it

It was dark, I saw two eyes
I kept going, I fell down
I started feeling stalactites

I thought, maybe I should get out of here
I turned around, my penis was blocking my way
I looked down, it wasn't my penis
It was somebody else's penis

I looked up, oh no
It was John Wayne's penis
I said, what are you doing in this cave?

He said, I'm here with John Wayne
I said, John Wayne's penis, what are you doing here?
He said, I'm here with John Wayne

I said, you mean John Wayne is in this cave?
He said, no, John Wayne
I said, oh

I turned around, started walking
I saw a little penis with a top hat and a cane
I said, are you John Wayne's penis?

He said, no, I am Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo
I am here with Hank Williams Jr.'s penis
I said, I see

I turned around, I saw a glowing penis
I said, are you Hank Williams Jr.'s penis?
He said, no, I am the supernatural emissary
From the great beyond, I am here with Elvis

I said,
