I started questioning
I started reading
All the words that were written on the wall
I never knew I
I never knew why
I read it through the
Noise that surrounds me
I never wanted
To hear what's not
I started questioning
I started reading again
I never knew I
I never knew why
I read it through the
Noise that surrounds me
I never wanted
To hear what's not
I started questioning
I started reading again
I never knew I
I never knew why
I read it through the
Noise that surrounds me
I never wanted
To hear what's not
I started questioning
I started reading again
I never knew I
I never knew why
I read it through the
Noise that surrounds me
I never wanted
To hear what's not
