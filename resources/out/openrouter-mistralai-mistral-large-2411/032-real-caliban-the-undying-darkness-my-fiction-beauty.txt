I'm lost in dreams so dark
My fiction beauty
I can't wake up
I can't face the day

I'm lost in dreams so dark
My fiction beauty
I can't wake up
I can't face the day

I'm lost in dreams so dark
My fiction beauty
I can't wake up
I can't face the day

I'm lost in dreams so dark
My fiction beauty
I can't wake up
I can't face the day

In this undying darkness
I can't find the light
In this undying darkness
I can't find the way

I'm lost in dreams so dark
My fiction beauty
I can't wake up
I can't face the day

In this undying darkness
I can't find the light
In this undying darkness
I can't find the way

I'm lost in dreams so dark
My fiction beauty
I can't wake up
I can't face the day
