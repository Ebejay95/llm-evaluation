I'm hanging around
I'm waiting for something to happen
I'm making my way
To the river or the frozen lake

I'm sitting around
I'm talking with some friends of mine
We're making our plans
To be in each other's company

And we'll go down
To Fountain and Vine
To the river or maybe to the frozen lake

I'm riding around
I'm going downtown with my windows down
I'm feeling so high
I'm watching the buildings scrape the sky

I'm stepping out
I'm walking around with my hands in my pockets
I'm losing my mind
I'm waiting for something to happen soon

And we'll go down
To Fountain and Vine
To the river or maybe to the frozen lake

I'm laying around
I'm hanging out with some friends of mine
We're making our plans
To be in each other's company

And we'll go down
To Fountain and Vine
To the river or maybe to the frozen lake
