I've got special needs
And it hurts so bad
It's in your face
But you don't see

I've got special needs
And I want it now
I want it bad
I want it now

I've got wounds to prove
That I'm alive
I've got scars to show
That hope survives

I've got special needs
And it's in your eyes
It's in your eyes
It's in your eyes

I've got special needs
And I want it fast
I want it now
I want it fast

I've got special needs
And I come so slow
I come so slow
I come so slow

I've got special needs
And I want it now
I want it bad
I want it now
