I'm torn between the light and dark
Where others see their targets, divine symmetry
Should I believe the vision, that flies before my eyes?
The lives we're living now, to find the balance real
The leathered falcon, under the hood
At least, I think, I've paid

I know you got your popular problems

Was I unkind to my love
Did I turn my head as she offered her suffering
Was I blind to her pain
Did I drift away, did I drift away
When she needed me to stay
