I'm on fire, in your garden
You've got me twisted, but I'm not frightened
Strange pleasures, in the haze
Got me down on my knees, in a daze

You're like a fever, that I can't shake
Got me spinning, in your undertow
In your jungle, I'm lost in the heat
Feeling hungry, but I can't eat

You're like a river, that's pulling me in
Got me drowning, in all of your sin
In your mirror, I see my reflection
Got me craving, your sweet infection
