I am not the kind of woman
To sit around and be sorry for you
I wear the pants just like a man does
And I will not be held down by a dude like you

I am not your currency
I won't be your sanctuary
Or your smoke screen
For all of your insecurities

You can tell from my face
I'm enjoying the space
That I've created from you
And all of your bad views

Don't get upset
Don't be so ungrateful
I am just an actress
Playing the role that you gave me

I am not the kind of woman
To sit around and be sorry for you
I wear the pants just like a man does
And I will not be held down by a dude like you

You can tell from my face
I'm enjoying the space
That I've created from you
And all of your bad news

I am just an actress
Playing the role that you gave me

I am not the kind of woman
To sit around and be sorry for you
I wear the pants just like a man does
And I will not be held down by a dude like you

You can tell from my face
I'm enjoying the space
That I've created from you
And all of your bad news

I am just an actress
Playing the role that you gave me

Don't tell me to smile
I'll bite off your head
Don't tell me to change
I'll break all your fingers

I am not the kind of woman
To sit around and be sorry for you
I wear the pants just like a man does
And I will not be held down by a dude like you

You can tell from my face
I'm enjoying the space
That I've created from you
And all of your bad news

I am just an actress
Playing the role that you gave me
