I've got no more chances to take
No more lines in the sand
My joyride's at an end
I've got no more bridges to burn
No more dreams to hold on to
I'm searching for solid ground

I'm reaching out for something real
I need to feel
I'm tired of drowning in my self-control

Maybe these memories are better off alone
I trade them in for dreams that I have known
And maybe this heartache can be replaced
With the memories that I've let go

I've got no more chances to take
No more lines in the sand
My joyride's at an end
I've got no more bridges to burn
No more dreams to hold on to
I'm searching for solid ground

I'm reaching out for something real
I need to feel
I'm tired of drowning in my self-control

Maybe these memories are better off alone
I trade them in for dreams that I have known
And maybe this heartache can be replaced
With the memories that I've let go

I'm reaching out for something real

I'm tired of drowning in my self-control

Maybe these memories are better off alone
I trade them in for dreams that I have known
