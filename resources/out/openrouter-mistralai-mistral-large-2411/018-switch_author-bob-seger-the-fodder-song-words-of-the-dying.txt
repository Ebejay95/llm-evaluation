I've seen the streets of poverty
And I've walked them many a day
I've seen the people in their rags
And I've heard what they had to say
I've seen the rich in their big fine homes
And I've heard their silver tone
But the strongest voice that I have heard
Was the whisper from a man alone

He said I don't need your gold or silver
I don't need your fancy car
All I want is someone to love me
Accept me for what I really are

He said I don't need no fine religion
I don't need no loud prayer
All I want is someone to love me
And know that somebody really care

Then he slowly drifted off to sleep
And he never woke no more
But the words he spoke are still with me
And they'll stay with me forevermore

He said I don't need no fine religion
I don't need no loud prayer
All I want is someone to love me
And know that somebody really care.
