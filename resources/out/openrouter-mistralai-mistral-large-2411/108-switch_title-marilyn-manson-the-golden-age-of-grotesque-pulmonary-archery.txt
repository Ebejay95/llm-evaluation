This isn't really me
This isn't really you
We're just two people fucking in a room
And I will never be this filthy
And you will never be this cool

We're just two dead souls
Floating down a river of silt
And I will never be this dirty
And you will never be this hurt

I want to use you
I want to bruise you
I want to be your blow-up doll
And I will never be this empty
And you will never be this full

We're just two dead souls
Floating down a river of shit
And I will never be this dirty
And you will never be this hurt

I want to use you
I want to bruise you
I want to be your blow-up doll
And I will never be this empty
And you will never be this full

I want to use you
I want to bruise you
I want to be your blow-up doll
And I will never be this empty
And you will never be this full
