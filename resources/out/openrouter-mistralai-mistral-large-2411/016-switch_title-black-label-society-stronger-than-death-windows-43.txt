Pissing my life, pissing my life away,
In this world of bullshit, bullshit and decay,
I don't need your fucking, fucking sympathy,
I've got my misery, misery to keep me company.

I'm stronger than death, stronger than your will,
I'm stronger than life, stronger than you kill,
I'm stronger than hate, stronger than your lies,
I'm stronger than you think, I will fucking rise.

I'm stronger than pain, stronger than your fear,
I'm stronger than love, that you'll never tear,
I'm stronger than time, stronger than this place,
I'm stronger than you and I will win this race.

I'm stronger than death, stronger than your will,
I'm stronger than life, stronger than you kill,
I'm stronger than hate, stronger than your lies,
I'm stronger than you think, I will fucking rise.

Don't need your fucking, fucking sympathy,
I've got my misery, misery to keep me company.

I'm stronger than death, stronger than your will,
I'm stronger than life, stronger than you kill,
I'm stronger than hate, stronger than your lies,
I'm stronger than you think, I will fucking rise.

I will fucking rise, I will fucking rise.
