I won't let this suffering be masked
Awake to this dire fate
The cost of a heart unguarded
The shattered illusion of trust

I won't let this failure define my life
Or let this depression become myself

The weak will fall
The strong will resist

I won't let this failure define my life
Or let this depression become myself

The weak will fall
The strong will resist

I won't let this failure define my life
Or let this depression become myself

The weak will fall
The strong will resist

The weak will fall
The strong will resist
