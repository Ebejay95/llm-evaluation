She's got witchcraft in her eyes,
And she's got cobwebs in her hair,
She's got a touch of sugar,
And a little bit of spice,
She's got a first-class chassis,
That everyone admires,
She's got a heart like a rock,
That's gonna take another man,
She's my witch, can't you see which,
She's my witch, yeah, yeah, yeah.
