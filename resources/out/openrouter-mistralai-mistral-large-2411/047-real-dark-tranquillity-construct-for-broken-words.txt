In the coldest hour of despair
A silent prayer to the dead
We built this phrase on shifting sands
A truth that never can be said

For every word, for every lie
A shadow crawls across the sun
We built this house on broken words
A silence spoken by everyone

In the coldest hour of despair
A silent prayer to the dead
We built this phrase on shifting sands
A truth that never can be said

For every word, for every lie
A shadow crawls across the sun
We built this house on broken words
A silence spoken by everyone

We built this house on broken words
A silence spoken by everyone

As we speak, the words take flight
In the echoes of our breath
As we speak, the words take flight
In the echoes of our breath

We built this house on broken words
A silence spoken by everyone
