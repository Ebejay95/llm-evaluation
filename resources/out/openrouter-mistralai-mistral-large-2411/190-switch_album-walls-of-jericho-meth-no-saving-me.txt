I'm the one you warned your kids about
I'm the monster in your closet
I'm the demon underneath your bed
I'm the shadow in your nightmares
I'm the devil in your house of god
I'm the ghost that's in your head
I'm the voice that's screaming out
I'm the silence in your pain
I'm the reason you're insane
I'm the reason you're alive
I'm the reason you're alone
I'm the reason you're awake
I'm the reason you're afraid
I'm the reason you're aware
I'm the reason you're alive
I'm the reason you're alone
I'm the reason you're awake
I'm the reason you're afraid
I'm the reason you're aware
I'm the reason you're alive
I'm the reason you're alone
I'm the reason you're awake
I'm the reason you're afraid
I'm the reason you're aware
I'm the reason you're alive
I'm the reason you're alone
