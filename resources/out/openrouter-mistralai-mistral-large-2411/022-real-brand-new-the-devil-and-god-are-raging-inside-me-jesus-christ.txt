In a hole there's a man with nothing in his eyes
Says he'd be thankful if you'd spit into his mouth
He's alive, but he won't survive the fight
He's alive, but he won't survive the night

Jesus Christ, I'm not scared to die
I'm still only twenty-five

For all the things that you've blessed me with
I'm not afraid, but I'm not at peace
Jesus Christ, I'm alone again
So what did you do those three days you were dead?

'Cause this problem's gonna last more than the weekend
'Cause this problem's gonna last more than forever

But nobody came, so he laid in the grave
He's alive, but he won't survive the night

Jesus Christ, I'm not scared to die
But I'm still only twenty-five

For all the things that you've blessed me with
I'm not afraid, but I'm not at peace
Jesus Christ, I'm alone again
So what did you do those three days you were dead?

'Cause this problem's gonna last more than the weekend
'Cause this problem's gonna last more than forever

And I know, we've got a lot of friends
But they've all got knives in their hands

Jesus Christ, I'm alone again
So what did you do those three days you were dead?

'Cause this problem's gonna last more than the weekend
'Cause this problem's gonna last more than forever

And I know, we've got a lot of friends
But they've all got knives, they've all got knives
They've all got knives in their hands
