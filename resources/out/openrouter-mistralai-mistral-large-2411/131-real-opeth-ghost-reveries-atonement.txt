I have been pressed down beneath the surface
Tried to escape but it's useless
I have been called out to where the silence dwells
In the darkest place
In the darkest place

There is no hope left here

I have been searching for a trace of light
In the hollow eyes of the dead
I have been calling out your name in vain
In the darkest place
In the darkest place

There is no hope left here

I have been crawling through the filth and the decay
In the shadows cast by the ghosts
I have been screaming out your name in vain
In the darkest place
In the darkest place

There is no hope left here

I have been waiting for the storm to end
But the rain keeps on falling
I have been searching for a trace of light
In the hollow eyes of the dead

I have been calling out your name in vain
In the darkest place
In the darkest place

There is no hope left here

I have been crawling through the filth and the decay
In the shadows cast by the ghosts
I have been screaming out your name in vain
In the darkest place
In the darkest place

There is no hope left here

I have been waiting for the storm to end
But the rain keeps on falling
I have been searching for a trace of light
In the hollow eyes of the dead

I have been calling out your name in vain
In the darkest place
In the darkest place

There is no hope left here

I have been crawling through the filth and the decay
In the shadows cast by the ghosts
I have been screaming out your name in vain
In the darkest place
In the darkest place

There is no hope left here

I have been waiting for the storm to end
But the rain keeps on falling
I have been searching for a trace of light
In the hollow eyes of the dead

I have been calling out your name in vain
In the darkest place
In the darkest place

There is no hope left here

I have been crawling through the filth and the decay
In the shadows cast by the ghosts
I have been screaming out your name in vain
In the darkest place
In the darkest place

There is no hope left here

I have been waiting for the storm to end
But the rain keeps on falling
I have been searching for a trace of light
In the hollow eyes of the dead

I have been calling out your name in vain
In the darkest place
In the darkest place

There is no hope left here

I have been crawling through the filth and the decay
In the shadows cast by the ghosts
I have been screaming out your name in vain
In the darkest place
In the darkest place

There is no hope left here

I have been waiting for the storm to end
But the rain keeps on falling
I have been searching for a trace of light
In the hollow eyes of the dead

I have been calling out your name in vain
In the darkest place
In the darkest place

There is no hope left here

In the shadows cast by the ghosts
I have been screaming out your name in vain
In the darkest place
In the darkest place

There is no hope left here
