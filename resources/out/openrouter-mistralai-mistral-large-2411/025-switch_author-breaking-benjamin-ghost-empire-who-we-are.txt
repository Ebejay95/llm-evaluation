We are the youth, we are the ones,
Trying to find where we belong,
It's in our hearts, it's in our souls,
Trying to find where we fit in,
We are the ones that want to be,
More than the shadow of a dream,
We are the ones that want our lives,
To mean something more than it seems,
We are the ones that want to live,
We are the ones that want to be,
We are the ones that want to know,
Who we are,
We are the ones that want to find,
The truth that's hidden in our minds,
We are the ones that want to see,
The world that's hidden in our dreams,
We are the ones that want to live,
We are the ones that want to be,
We are the ones that want to know,
Who we are.
