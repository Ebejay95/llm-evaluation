I wake up in the morning, I go to bed at night,
I live my life in dreamland, I don't know what is right,
I see your face before me, as I turn out the light,
I need your love, I need your touch, I need you every night.

I can't believe it when you tell me that you understand,
I can't conceive it when you say you love another man,
I can't believe that life could be so full of pain,
I want your love, I want your touch, I want it all again.

You spin me right round, baby, right round like a record, baby,
Right round round round
You spin me right round, baby, right round like a record, baby,
Right round round round

I knew my love for you would keep me strong,
I knew that you would do me wrong, oh for so long,
I search for life's eternal truth, but all I find is you,
I give myself a brand new dose, of what I like to do.

You spin me right round, baby, right round like a record, baby,
Right round round round
You spin me right round, baby, right round like a record, baby,
Right round round round.
