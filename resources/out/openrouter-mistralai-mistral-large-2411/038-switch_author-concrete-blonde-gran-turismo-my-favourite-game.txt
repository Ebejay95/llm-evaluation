I've been driving all night
My hands are wet on the wheel
There's a hole in my heart
There's a bee in my bonnet
There's a story to tell

Oh, the brake light's red soul is glowing
I've been driving all night
To be somewhere

I've been eating dust
Kicking my fate
There's a demon in me
There's original sin
And I'm not winning

Oh, the headlight's white eyes are blinding
I've been driving all day
To be somewhere

I've been spinning
I've been spinning
I've been spinning
I've been spinning

Oh, the brake light's red soul is glowing
I've been driving all night
To be somewhere

Oh, the headlight's white eyes are blinding
I've been driving all day
To be somewhere

Oh, the brake light's red soul is glowing
I've been driving all night
To be somewhere

Oh, the headlight's white eyes are blinding
I've been driving all day
To be somewhere
