I'm slipping away, I'm slipping
Feels like I'm hanging by a moment
I'm slipping away, I'm slipping
Feels like I'm hanging by a thread

I wanna feel you in my arms again
I wish that I could let you in
But I'm not everything that I want to be
I'm so tired of this haven't you heard

I'm hanging by a moment here with you
I'm hanging by a moment, all I need
I'm hanging by a moment here with you
Here with you, here with you

I'm slipping away, I'm slipping
Feels like I'm hanging by a moment
I'm slipping away, I'm slipping
Feels like I'm hanging by a thread

I wanna tell you that I love you
But it comes out all wrong, that's what I say
I push it all away, it's just a dream
I'm wide awake, haven't you heard

I'm hanging by a moment here with you
I'm hanging by a moment, all I need
I'm hanging by a moment here with you
Here with you, here with you

I'm hanging by a moment here with you
I'm hanging by a moment, all I need
I'm hanging by a moment here with you
Here with you, here with you

I'm hanging by a moment here with you
I'm hanging by a moment, all I need
I'm hanging by a moment here with you
Here with you, here with you
