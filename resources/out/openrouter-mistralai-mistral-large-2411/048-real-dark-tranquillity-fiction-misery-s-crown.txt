I've seen worlds within me collapse
In this waking dream
I've seen hatred grow from the ashes
Of love's dying scream

I've seen joy that never will come again
In this waking dream
I've seen hope that never will come again
In this waking dream

I've seen worlds within me collapse
In this waking dream
I've seen hatred grow from the ashes
Of love's dying scream

I've seen joy that never will come again
In this waking dream
I've seen hope that never will come again
In this waking dream

As the circle is closed
And the end is reborn
As the circle is closed
And the end is reborn

I've seen worlds within me collapse
In this waking dream
I've seen hatred grow from the ashes
Of love's dying scream

I've seen joy that never will come again
In this waking dream
I've seen hope that never will come again
In this waking dream
