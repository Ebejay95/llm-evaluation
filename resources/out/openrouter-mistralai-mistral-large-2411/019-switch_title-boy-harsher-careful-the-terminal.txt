I might let you down
Into the fire
You know I'm far from home
Into your eyes

I can't get through to you
It's like you're already gone
I can't get through to you
It's like you're already gone

I saw it in your eyes
The moment that you checked out
I saw it in your eyes
The moment that you checked out

I might let you down
Into the fire
You know I'm far from home
Into your eyes

I can't get through to you
It's like you're already gone
I can't get through to you
It's like you're already gone

I saw it in your eyes
The moment that you checked out
I saw it in your eyes
The moment that you checked out

I might let you down
Into the fire
You know I'm far from home
Into your eyes
