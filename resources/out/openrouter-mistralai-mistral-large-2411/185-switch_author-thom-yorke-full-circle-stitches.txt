Wake up from your dream
The sun is eating the sea
The lions in your garden
They seem so hungry

I woke up in a pile
Of feathers and fur
The smell of the desert
And the stitches torn

I don't want no stitches
I don't want no stitches now

The lions in your garden
They seem so hungry

I don't want no stitches
I don't want no stitches now
