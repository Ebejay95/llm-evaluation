I got a letter, from a Swiss miss
She said she wanted, to give me a kiss
She sent a picture, of a pretty place
The cuckoo clock was, hanging in space

She said she'd take me, to the Alps someday
We'd make the snow melt, in every way
I want to yodel, from on high
Switzerland, don't let me die

I want to yodel, from on high
Switzerland, don't let me die

She sent a picture, of a pretty place
The cuckoo clock was, hanging in space
She said she'd take me, to the Alps someday
We'd make the snow melt, in every way

I want to yodel, from on high
Switzerland, don't let me die

I want to yodel, from on high
Switzerland, don't let me die

She sent a picture, of a pretty place
The cuckoo clock was, hanging in space
She said she'd take me, to the Alps someday
We'd make the snow melt, in every way

I want to yodel, from on high
Switzerland, don't let me die

I want to yodel, from on high
Switzerland, don't let me die

I want to yodel, from on high
Switzerland, don't let me die

I want to yodel, from on high
Switzerland, don't let me die
