In this life, we're just passengers
On this train, we call reality
The destination, unknown
But the journey, that's the thing

We can laugh, we can cry
We can dance, we can sing
But in the end, it's all the same
We're just waiting, waiting for you

So here's to the memories
And the dreams that we pursue
To the love, and the laughter
And the things we never knew

We're just waiting, waiting for you
Waiting for you, waiting for you
