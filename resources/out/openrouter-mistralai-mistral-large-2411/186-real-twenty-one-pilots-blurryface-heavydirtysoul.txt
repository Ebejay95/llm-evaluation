I can't be trusted, even in small quantities.
I know I'm evil, don't know what I'm capable of.
This isn't what you signed up for, this isn't even my
true voice.
This isn't my true color, this isn't my true voice.
Can you save, can you save my,
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?
Can you save, can you save my,
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?

Death inspires me like a dog inspires a rabbit.
I'm not evil, don't put me in that basket.
This isn't what you signed up for, this isn't even my
true voice.
This isn't my true color, this isn't my true voice.
Can you save, can you save my,
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?
Can you save, can you save my,
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?

Gangsters don't cry, therefore, therefore I'm
Mr. Misty-Eyed.
The streets are dry, but, but, therefore I'm
Mr. Misty-Eyed.
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?
