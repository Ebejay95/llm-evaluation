There's a war going on for your mind
So if you're trying to get mine
You better come with the sound
And the rhythm that's righteous and tight

'Cause I'm fighting for my life
And the battle's in the night
So I keep my eyes open wide
And I look to the rising sun

There's a war going on for your mind
And since I'm running out of time
I'm gonna sing it out loud
Gonna sing my song for the crowd
