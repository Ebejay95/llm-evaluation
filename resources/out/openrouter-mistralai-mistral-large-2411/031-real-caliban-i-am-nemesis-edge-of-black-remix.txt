I can't feel the sun on my face anymore
I can't hear the sound of the world outside
I can't see the light at the end of the tunnel
I can't find the way back to the surface

I am lost in this darkness
I am drowning in this silence
I am falling into the abyss
I am fading into the black

I can't feel my heart beat in my chest
I can't hear my own voice in my head
I can't see my reflection in the mirror
I can't find my way back to the light

I am lost in this emptiness
I am drowning in this silence
I am falling into the void
I am fading into the black

I am the edge of black
I am the end of the line
I am the point of no return
I am the silence that follows the storm

I am the edge of black
I am the end of the road
I am the final breath
I am the last beat of the heart

I am the edge of black
I am the end of the fight
I am the final goodbye
I am the last light in the night.
