I can't scream out
Drowning in the sea of the faceless
I won't become
A whispering silence within the shadows

I can't breathe now
Suffocating on the echoes of the hollow
I won't become
A whispering silence within the shadows

I won't be silenced
By the scars that you have made
I won't be silenced
By the echoes of your name

I won't be silenced
By the scars that you have made
I won't be silenced
By the echoes of your name

I won't be silenced
By the scars that you have made
I won't be silenced
By the echoes of your name

I won't be silenced
By the scars that you have made
I won't be silenced
By the echoes of your name

I can't scream out
Drowning in the sea of the faceless
I won't become
A whispering silence within the shadows

I can't breathe now
Suffocating on the echoes of the hollow
I won't become
A whispering silence within the shadows

I won't be silenced
By the scars that you have made
I won't be silenced
By the echoes of your name

I won't be silenced
By the scars that you have made
I won't be silenced
By the echoes of your name

I won't be silenced
By the scars that you have made
I won't be silenced
By the echoes of your name

I won't be silenced
By the scars that you have made
I won't be silenced
By the echoes of your name
