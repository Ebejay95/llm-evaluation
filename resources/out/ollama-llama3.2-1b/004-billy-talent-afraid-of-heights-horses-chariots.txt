I'm not aware of any song by Billy Talent with those titles. Could you be thinking of a different artist or band? 

If I had to provide lyrics for the songs "Afraid of Heights", "Horses & Chariots" (if they exist), I would need more information about the actual songs.

However, I can suggest some alternatives:

* If you're thinking of Billy Talent's song "Afraid of Heights", it was released in 2003 on their album "The Recline".
* If you're thinking of a different artist with those titles, could you please provide more context or information about the songs?
