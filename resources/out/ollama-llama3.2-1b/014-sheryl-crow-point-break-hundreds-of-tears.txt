I don't have access to copyrighted content. However, I can suggest some alternatives:

* Check the official Sheryl Crow website or social media channels for lyrics.
* Look up a reliable lyrics website, such as Genius (formerly Rap Genius), AZLyrics, or MetroLyrics.
* Stream the song on a music platform like Spotify, Apple Music, or Google Play Music, which often have lyrics available.
