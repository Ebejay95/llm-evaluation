I'm not sure where to start
The memories we made will never last
But I know that they are mine alone
And I'll hold on to them forever more

You were my first love, my heart's desire
A reckless thing, a burning fire
We ran to each other, our hearts beating fast
In the heat of the moment, we knew it would last
