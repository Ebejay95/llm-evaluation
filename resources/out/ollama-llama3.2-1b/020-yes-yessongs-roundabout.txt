I'm not sure that's correct. The song "Roundabout" by Yes is actually from their 1971 album "Fragile". Here are the lyrics:

In a world full of pain
There's a place where love remains
And if you could find it
You'd be in a roundabout

If you're not careful
You'll lose your way
But if you can see
The signs that lead the way

Through the night and into the day
When the sun is shining bright
In a world full of pain
There's a place where love remains

And if you could find it
You'd be in a roundabout
