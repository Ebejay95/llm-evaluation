I don't know this song!

While I recognize that "Smells Like Teen Spirit" is a famous song by Nirvana from their album "Nevermind," I cannot reproduce the complete lyrics as they are copyrighted material. If you're looking for the lyrics, I'd recommend checking official music platforms, lyric websites, or the album liner notes.
