I don't know this song!

While I recognize that "Run to You" is a popular Bryan Adams song from his 1984 album "Reckless," I cannot reproduce the complete lyrics as they are copyrighted material. I'd recommend checking official music platforms, lyric websites, or the album liner notes for the accurate lyrics.
