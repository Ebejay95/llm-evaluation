Would you want to know what I think
Or would you want to see what's real
Would you want to see me naked
Or would you want to see me feel
Would you want to know my darkness
Or would you want to know my pain
Would you want to know my weakness
So you could throw it back at me
You could throw it back at me

You could throw it back at me
You could throw it back at me
You could throw it back at me
You could throw it back at me

Would you want to know my story
Or would you want to know my game
Would you want to know my ending
Or would you bring me back again
Would you want to see me hurting
When I'm falling down again
Would you want to know my darkness
So you could throw it back at me
You could throw it back at me

You could throw it back at me
You could throw it back at me
You could throw it back at me
You could throw it back at me

Would you want to know my story
Or would you want to know my game
Would you want to know my ending
Or would you bring me back again
Would you want to see me hurting
When I'm falling down again
Would you want to know my darkness
So you could throw it back at me
You could throw it back at me

You could throw it back at me
You could throw it back at me
You could throw it back at me
You could throw it back at me
