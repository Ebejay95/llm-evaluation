I don't understand why you're leaving me
I don't understand, now who's gonna make my tea?
I don't understand, I thought that we were good
I don't understand, I guess I misunderstood

I don't understand why you're not in my bed
I don't understand, was it something I said?
I don't understand, I thought that we were fine
I don't understand, I guess you're not mine

I don't understand, I thought that we were cool
I don't understand, I feel like such a fool
I don't understand, I thought that we were great
I don't understand, I guess it's just fate

I don't understand, I thought that we were strong
I don't understand, I guess that I was wrong
I don't understand, I thought that we were tight
I don't understand, I guess it's just not right

I don't understand, I thought that we were sweet
I don't understand, I guess I'm just beat
I don't understand, I thought that we were fly
I don't understand, I guess this is goodbye.
