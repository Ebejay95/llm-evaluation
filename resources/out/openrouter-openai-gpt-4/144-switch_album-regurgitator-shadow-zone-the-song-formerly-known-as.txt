We don't need no sleep tonight
Everybody's bumping uglies
Bump it till it's sore
We don't need no sleep tonight
'Cause we're going on and on
We're going for a ride
Could be staring at you
In real life it's so sad
We'd better make a move
And sex it up a little bit
We don't need no sleep tonight
Everybody's doing something
So why can't we do nothing?
We don't need no sleep tonight
'Cause we're going on and on
We're going for a ride
Could be staring at you
In real life it's so sad
We'd better make a move
And sex it up a little bit
We don't need no sleep tonight
Everybody's bumping uglies
Bump it till it's sore
We don't need no sleep tonight
'Cause we're going on and on
We're going for a ride
Could be staring at you
In real life it's so sad
We'd better make a move
And sex it up a little bit
We don't need no sleep tonight
Everybody's doing something
So why can't we do nothing?
We don't need no sleep tonight
'Cause we're going on and on
We're going for a ride
Could be staring at you
In real life it's so sad
We'd better make a move
And sex it up a little bit
