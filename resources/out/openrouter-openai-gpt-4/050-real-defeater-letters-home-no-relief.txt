I've been trying to fill this hole in my chest
And it's been so hard to find rest
I've been grinding my teeth down to the bone
With no relief, no relief, no relief, no relief

I've been drinking myself to death
And it's been so hard to find rest
I've been grinding my teeth down to the bone
With no relief, no relief, no relief, no relief

I've been trying to fill this hole in my chest
And it's been so hard to find rest
I've been grinding my teeth down to the bone
With no relief, no relief, no relief, no relief

I've been drinking myself to death
And it's been so hard to find rest
I've been grinding my teeth down to the bone
With no relief, no relief, no relief, no relief

I've been trying to fill this hole in my chest
And it's been so hard to find rest
I've been grinding my teeth down to the bone
With no relief, no relief, no relief, no relief

I've been drinking myself to death
And it's been so hard to find rest
I've been grinding my teeth down to the bone
With no relief, no relief, no relief, no relief.
