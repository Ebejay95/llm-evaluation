No, I don't want to see you
Open your eyes
There is nothing you can say
Cause I don't want to listen
You know you lied
You've all but been forgiven
Nothing you can say
Can stop me from leaving
Cause you lied
Horror head
It's in your head
All the things that make you feel dead
Goodbye
I don't want to feel your
Heavy head
There is nothing you can say
That hasn't been said
I don't want to look at you
Cause your eyes
They burn me through and through
This is it
This is the end
