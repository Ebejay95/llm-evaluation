Cleared the fog that was veiling my eyes
Bare, wrested the truth from the lies
When I'm thirsty, I drink and I always adhere to the law
Come twilight, this city is bathed in my sorrow
Complaints ignored
You'll never see me repent for the sins of the past
Your wish is my command
Always ready to expand
Don't you know I'm an innocent victim of a blinded alley
And I'm just about to be
Turned inside out
Nothing to heal
No one to blame
As we're one, one and the same
Atonement seek
For you will find
Atonement's yours
For you to find
I close my eyes, still I'm sightless
Torn inside, and all I taste is bitterness
Roamed the dark in search of the answers
Is there a forgiving for my nemesis
And I left nothing behind
You're no different, you and I
Caught in a dream, tied to the stake
You're awake, you're aware
And you're a different kind, you're aware
You're a different kind
And you're aware, you're a different kind
Caught in a dream, tied to the stake
And you're a different kind
Caught in a dream, tied to the stake
