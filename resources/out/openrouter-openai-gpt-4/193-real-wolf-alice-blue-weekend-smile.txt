I ain't afraid though my steps appear tentative
I scope it out then I throw myself into it
I don't need your protection
I don't need for you to understand
I'm feeling the sus, it's coming over us
I'm feeling the sus, it's coming over us

I wear my feelings on my face
In case you won't look me in the eyes
I don't care for your attitude
You bring me down, I don't know why
I've got my hand on my heart
But my heart's in the gutter
Talking to herself, starting to flutter
When the lights go down and the room goes quiet
I'm happiest when I'm with you
Just picking fights on Brighton Pier
Coked up with my mates, I'm trying to keep it sincere

I ain't afraid though my steps appear tentative
I scope it out then I throw myself into it
I don't need your protection
I don't need for you to understand
I'm feeling the sus, it's coming over us
I'm feeling the sus, it's coming over us

I wear my feelings on my face
In case you won't look me in the eyes
I don't care for your attitude
You bring me down, I don't know why
I've got my hand on my heart
But my heart's in the gutter
Talking to herself, starting to flutter
When the lights go down and the room goes quiet
I'm happiest when I'm with you
Just picking fights on Brighton Pier
Coked up with my mates, I'm trying to keep it sincere

I ain't afraid though my steps appear tentative
I scope it out then I throw myself into it
I don't need your protection
I don't need for you to understand
I'm feeling the sus, it's coming over us
I'm feeling the sus, it's coming over us

I ain't afraid though my steps appear tentative
I scope it out then I throw myself into it
I don't need your protection
I don't need for you to understand
