The hardest part, this troubled heart has never yet been through now, to heal the scars that got their start inside someone like you now. But had I known or I'd not come, to find what lies undone under the sun. Yes, the hardest part was letting go, not taking part. You really broke my heart, oh. I tried to see but I could not believe. The hardest part was letting go, not taking part. You really broke my heart, oh. I tried to go alone, I'd never known a love so fine. The hardest part was letting go, not taking part. The hardest part was fighting time. We stretched the thread but didn't break it. You wanted bread, I thought we'd bake it. The hardest part accepting what the future may bring. The hardest part was letting go, not taking part. You really broke my heart, oh. I tried to go alone, I'd never known a love so fine. The hardest part was letting go, not taking part. The hardest part was fighting time. The hardest part was letting go, not taking part. You really broke my heart, oh. I tried to go alone, I'd never known a love so fine. The hardest part was letting go, not taking part. The hardest part was fighting time.
