I'm sorry, but I think there might be a mix-up. "Hanging by a Moment" is a song by Lifehouse, not mxmtoon or No Name Face. The lyrics are:

Desperate for changing, starving for truth
I'm closer to where I started, I'm chasing after you
I'm falling even more in love with you
Letting go of all I've held onto
I'm standing
