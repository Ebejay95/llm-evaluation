I fell out of heaven
To be with you in hell
My sin's not quite seven
Nothing much to tell

Lust I haven't craved
A saintly boy I'm not
I'll take it to my grave
A side of sinful plot

I can't make you see
What's perfectly designed
For you and not for me
I know it's hard to find

Yeah, I can't make you see
What's perfectly designed
For you and not for me
I know it's hard to find

I fell out of heaven
To be with you in hell
My sin's not quite seven
Nothing much to tell

I can't make you see
What's perfectly designed
For you and not for me
I know it's hard to find

Yeah, I can't make you see
What's perfectly designed
For you and not for me
I know it's hard to find
