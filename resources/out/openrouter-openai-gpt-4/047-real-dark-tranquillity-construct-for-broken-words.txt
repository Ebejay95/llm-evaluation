In the silence that followed
I saw our weary world in your eyes
When the sorrow gives in to the pain
In the light of one last setting sun
We suffer in the fires of the sun
For broken words
And a broken world
Lost in endless nights and broken dreams
In the silence that followed
I saw a dying world in your eyes
When the beauty gives in to decay
In the light of one last setting sun
We suffer in the fires of the sun
For broken words
And a broken world
Lost in endless nights and broken dreams
In the silence that followed
I saw a dying world in your eyes
When the beauty gives in to decay
In the light of one last setting sun
We suffer in the fires of the sun
For broken words
And a broken world
Lost in endless nights and broken dreams
In the silence that followed
I saw a dying world in your eyes
When the beauty gives in to decay
In the light of one last setting sun
We suffer in the fires of the sun
For broken words
And a broken world
Lost in endless nights and broken dreams
In the silence that followed
I saw a dying world in your eyes
When the beauty gives in to decay
In the light of one last setting sun
We suffer in the fires of the sun
For broken words
And a broken world
Lost in endless nights and broken dreams
