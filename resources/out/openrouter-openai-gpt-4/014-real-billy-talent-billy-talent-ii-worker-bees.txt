We are the worker bees of the heart
We take from the bottom and we tear it apart
There's no decision, no room for thought
It's easier to die than it is to be caught

In the belly of the beast, it's a sick, sick world
It's a sick, sick, sick, sick world
We are the worker bees, we are the worker bees

We are the worker bees of the heart
We take from the bottom and we tear it apart
There's no decision, no room for thought
It's easier to die than it is to be caught

In the belly of the beast, it's a sick, sick world
It's a sick, sick, sick, sick world
We are the worker bees, we are the worker bees

We are the worker bees of the heart
We take from the bottom and we tear it apart
There's no decision, no room for thought
It's easier to die than it is to be caught

In the belly of the beast, it's a sick, sick world
It's a sick, sick, sick, sick world
We are the worker bees, we are the worker bees

We are the worker bees of the heart
We take from the bottom and we tear it apart
There's no decision, no room for thought
It's easier to die than it is to be caught

In the belly of the beast, it's a sick, sick world
It's a sick, sick, sick, sick world
We are the worker bees, we are the worker bees
