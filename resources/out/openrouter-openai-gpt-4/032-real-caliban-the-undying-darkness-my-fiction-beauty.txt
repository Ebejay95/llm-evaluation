I can't stand the pain
Slowly I'm going insane
I swallow my tears
And taste the fears
I'm for sale and I'm dying
My soul's crying
I'm the fiction in my world of lies

I'm the mirror in your eyes
I'm the poetry in your new disguise
I'm the science in your mind
I'm the truth you'll never find
I'm the reason for your bleeding heart
I'm the beginning I'm the start
I'm the beauty in your art

I'm the war that's in your head
I'm the tears that you have bled
I'm the road you're walking on
I'm the words in your sad song
I'm the coldness in your heart
I'm the end and I'm the start
I'm the enemy in your bed

I'm the thoughts in your head
I'm the reason for your bleeding heart
I'm the beginning I'm the start
I'm the beauty in your art
I'm the fiction in my world of lies
I'm the mirror in your eyes
I'm the poetry in your new disguise
I'm the science in your mind
I'm the truth you'll never find
I'm the reason for your bleeding heart
I'm the beginning I'm the start
I'm the beauty in your art
