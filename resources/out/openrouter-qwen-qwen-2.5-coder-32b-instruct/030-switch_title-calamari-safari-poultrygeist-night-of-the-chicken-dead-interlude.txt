Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics of the interlude from "Calamari Safari" by Poultrygeist - Night of the Chicken Dead. First, I need to confirm if I have the correct song. The title seems a bit confusing because "Calamari Safari" is a song by The Black Keys, and "Poultrygeist - Night of the Chicken Dead" is a movie. Maybe the user is mixing up the song and the movie. Let me check.

The movie "Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead" is a horror-comedy, and it's possible that the song "Calamari Safari" is featured in it. The interlude might be a part of the song included in the movie's soundtrack. I need to verify if there's an interlude in the song as part of the movie. 

Looking up the song structure, "Calamari Safari" by The Black Keys is a regular track without an interlude. However, if the movie uses a version with an interlude, that might be a different arrangement. Since I don't have specific information about an interlude in this context, I should check if there's any known interlude version. 

If I can't find the exact lyrics for an interlude, the correct response would be to say "I don't know this song!" as per the KB instruction. The user might be conflating the song with the movie, so it's important to be accurate. Since there's no evidence of an interlude in the standard version, and without more details, I should respond that I don't know the specific lyrics they're asking for.
