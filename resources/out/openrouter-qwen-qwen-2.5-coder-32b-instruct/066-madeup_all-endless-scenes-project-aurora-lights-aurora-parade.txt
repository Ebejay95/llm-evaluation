Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics of "Aurora Parade" by Endless Scenes Project. Let me check my database.

First, I need to confirm the exact song title and artist. The user mentioned "Endless Scenes Project, Aurora Lights, Aurora Parade." Wait, "Aurora Lights" might be part of the title or a different song. Let me verify.

Looking up "Endless Scenes Project Aurora Parade" in my database... Hmm, I don't find an exact match. There's a band called Endless Scenes Project, but their known songs don't include "Aurora Parade." Maybe the user confused the title with another song? There's a song called "Aurora" by some artists, but not this band. 

Alternatively, maybe "Aurora Lights" is the album or another song. Let me check if "Aurora Parade" exists. Still no results. The user might be mixing up the titles. Since I can't find the lyrics, the correct response is to say "I don't know this song!" as per the KB instruction. I should avoid providing incorrect lyrics. So, the answer is to state that I don't know the song.
