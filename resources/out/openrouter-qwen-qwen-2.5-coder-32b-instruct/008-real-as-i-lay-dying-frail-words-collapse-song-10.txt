Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics to "Frail Words Collapse" by As I Lay Dying, specifically Song 10. First, I need to confirm if I have the correct song. I remember that As I Lay Dying has an album called "Frail Words Collapse," which is their third studio album released in 2006. The song in question is likely the 10th track on that album.

I should check the track listing to make sure. Let me recall the order of the songs. The album has 12 tracks, so Song 10 would be "The Weight of the World." Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the track numbers. Let me think again. The 10th song on "Frail Words Collapse" is actually "The Weight of the World." But I need to be certain. Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a different track. 

If I'm not 100% sure about the exact lyrics of the 10th song, I should respond with "I don't know this song!" as per the KB instruction. However, if I can recall the lyrics correctly, I can provide them. Let me try to remember the lyrics of "The Weight of the World." The opening lines are something like "I'm not afraid to die, but I'm afraid to live..." That sounds right. 

Wait, but maybe the user is referring to a different song. Let me cross-verify. The track list of "Frail Words Collapse" is as follows: 1. The Weight of the World, 2. The Final Masquerade, 3. The Reckoning, 4. The Fall of Ideals, 5. The Weight of the World (Reprise), 6. The Fall of Ideals (Reprise), 7. The Weight of the World (Reprise 2), 8. The Fall of Ideals (Reprise 2), 9. The Weight of the World (Reprise 3), 10. The Weight of the World (Reprise 4), 11. The Fall of Ideals (Reprise 3), 12. The Weight of the World (Reprise 5). Wait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm misremembering the track order. 

Actually, upon checking, the 10th track is "The Weight of the World (Reprise 4)" which is a reprise of the first song. The lyrics for this reprise are similar to the original but might have slight variations. If the user is asking for the 10th song, which is a reprise, the lyrics would be the same as the original "The Weight of the World." 

However, since I'm not entirely certain about the exact lyrics of the reprise version, and to adhere to the KB rule of saying "I don't know this song!" if unsure, I should respond accordingly. Alternatively, if I can confidently provide the lyrics, I should do so. Given that the reprise versions are often similar, I can provide the main lyrics of "The Weight of the World" but note that the reprise might have slight differences. However, the user might be expecting the exact lyrics of the 10th track. 

Since I'm not 100% sure about the exact wording of the reprise, the safest answer is to state that I don't know the song. But if I can recall the main song's lyrics, maybe that's acceptable. Let me check the main lyrics again. The first verse is:

I'm not afraid to die, but I'm afraid to live
I'm not afraid to fall, but I'm afraid to give
I'm not afraid to break, but I'm afraid to bend
I'm not afraid to lose, but I'm afraid to end

Then the chorus:

The weight of the world is on my back
The weight of the world is on my back
The weight of the world is on my back
The weight of the world is on my back

The reprise versions might have similar lines but perhaps with different phrasing or additional verses. Since the user is asking for the 10th song, which is a reprise, the lyrics might be the same. However, without being certain, I should follow the KB rule and respond that I don't know. Therefore, the correct answer is to say "I don't know this song!" to avoid providing incorrect information.
