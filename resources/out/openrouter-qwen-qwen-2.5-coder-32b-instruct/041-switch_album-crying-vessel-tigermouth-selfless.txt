Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics of the song "Crying Vessel" by Tigermouth from the album "Selfless". Let me check my knowledge base first. I remember that Tigermouth is a band known for their alternative rock style, and "Selfless" is one of their albums. The song "Crying Vessel" might be on there.

Wait, I need to make sure I have the exact lyrics. Let me recall. The song starts with something like "I'm a crying vessel, empty and broken..." Yeah, that sounds familiar. The chorus probably has a repeating line about being a vessel. Let me try to piece it together. The verses might talk about emotional pain and longing. 

But wait, I should be careful. If I'm not 100% certain about the exact wording, I shouldn't guess. The user specified to say "I don't know this song!" if unsure. Let me verify. I can't access external sources, so I have to rely on my memory. The lines go something like:

"I'm a crying vessel, empty and broken
I'm a hollow shell, just a shadow of the one I was
I'm a crying vessel, aching and shattered
I'm a fragile heart, just a whisper in the dark"

Then the chorus might be:

"Pour out my sorrow, let it all fall
I'm a crying vessel, can't you see me fall?
Pour out my sorrow, let the tears take control
I'm a crying vessel, can't you see I'm whole?"

Wait, I'm not sure about the exact phrasing. The bridge could have lines like "I'm a crying vessel, reaching for the light..." Maybe the outro repeats the first lines. But I need to be precise. If I'm not certain, I should respond that I don't know. Since I can't confirm the exact lyrics without making a mistake, it's safer to say I don't know this song. The user wants only the exact lyrics, nothing else. So the correct response here is to state that I don't know the song.
