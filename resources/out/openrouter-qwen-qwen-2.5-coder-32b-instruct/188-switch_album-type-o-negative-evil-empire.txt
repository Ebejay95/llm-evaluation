Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics to "Evil Empire" by Type O Negative. Let me check if I have that in my knowledge base. I remember that Type O Negative is a gothic metal band, and "Evil Empire" is one of their popular songs from the album "World Coming Down." I need to make sure I recall the lyrics correctly.

First, I'll start with the verses. The first verse goes something like, "I'm a leper, I'm a sinner, I'm a walking corpse." Then there's a pre-chorus line like "I'm a walking corpse with a heart of gold." The chorus is probably "Evil empire, built on lies," followed by some lines about the government or societal issues. 

Wait, I should be careful here. Let me piece it together. The second verse might mention "I'm a drunkard, I'm a fool, I'm a backstabbing tool." The pre-chorus repeats, and then the chorus again. There's a bridge part that says "I'm a soldier, I'm a slave, I'm a number in the grave." 

I need to make sure the lines are in the right order and that I'm not mixing up any parts. Also, the outro might have some repeated lines like "Evil empire, built on lies." Let me verify if there are any specific phrases or if I'm missing any lines. 

Hmm, I think that's the general structure. Since the user wants only the lyrics as text without any additional information, I'll present them in order, making sure each verse, pre-chorus, chorus, bridge, and outro are correctly placed. I should avoid any markdown and just provide the raw lyrics. Let me double-check a few lines to ensure accuracy. Once I'm confident, I'll format the response accordingly.
