Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics to "Hollow Windows" by Neon Windows Collective from the album "Red River". Let me start by checking if I have the correct song. First, I need to confirm the band name, song title, and album. Sometimes there might be similar names or different versions.

Neon Windows Collective isn't a band I'm immediately familiar with, so I should verify if this is a real band and song. A quick search in my database... Hmm, I don't find any exact matches. There's a possibility the user might have misspelled the band name or the song title. Let me check variations. Maybe "Neon Window Collective" instead of "Neon Windows Collective"? Or perhaps the song is part of a different album?

Looking up "Hollow Windows" by Neon Windows Collective... Still no results. The album "Red River" doesn't seem to be associated with this band in my current data. It's possible that the song is obscure or not widely available in standard music databases. Alternatively, the user might be referring to a different band or a song with a similar name.

I should also consider that the user might have mixed up the band and song titles. For example, there's a band called "The Hollow Windows" but that's different. Another angle: maybe the user is referring to a song by a different artist with similar lyrics or themes. However, the request is specific to the given band, song, and album.

Since I can't find the exact lyrics, the best course of action is to inform the user that I don't have the lyrics for that specific song. I should respond with the predefined message: "I don't know this song!" as per the KB instructions. It's important to avoid providing incorrect or fabricated lyrics, even if the user is insistent. Accuracy is key here.
