Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics to "Atonement" by Opeth from the album "Ghost Reveries." Let me check if I have the correct lyrics. I need to make sure I'm not mixing up the songs. "Atonement" is indeed a track on that album. I'll start by recalling the structure: verses, choruses, maybe a bridge. The first verse starts with "I have sinned..." and there's a recurring theme of guilt and seeking redemption. The chorus has lines like "I will atone..." I should verify each line to ensure accuracy. Also, the user mentioned to only provide the lyrics as text, so no extra information or formatting. I need to make sure there are no typos. Let me cross-check with a reliable source to confirm the exact wording. Once I'm confident, I'll present the lyrics in order without any additional commentary.
