Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics of a song by Grotus, Mass, and Wiild Bill. Let me start by checking if I recognize these names. Grotus might be a typo; maybe they meant "Grotus" or another similar name. Mass could be part of a band name or a typo for "Mass" as in a group. Wiild Bill is likely a reference to Wild Bill, possibly a musician or a character.

First, I'll search my database for any songs associated with these names. Grotus doesn't ring a bell immediately. Maybe it's a lesser-known artist or a misspelling. "Mass" could be part of a band name like "Mass" or "Mass Effect," but that's a video game. Wiild Bill might be a typo for "Wild Bill" or "Wild Bill Hickok," a historical figure. 

I should check if there's a known collaboration between these three. If not, the user might have mixed up the names. Let me verify each name separately. "Wild Bill" could refer to Wild Bill Hickok, but there are songs about him, like "The Ballad of Wild Bill." However, the other names don't seem to connect. 

Since I can't find any exact matches for Grotus, Mass, and Wiild Bill together, it's possible the user made a mistake in the names. I should consider common songs about Wild Bill Hickok. The lyrics to "The Ballad of Wild Bill" are well-known. Let me recall those. The song is a traditional folk song, so the lyrics might be in the public domain. 

The user might be looking for that song but mentioned the wrong artists. Since I can't confirm the exact song they're asking for, the safest response is to say I don't know the song. However, if I think they might be referring to "The Ballad of Wild Bill," I could provide those lyrics. But since the user specified the artists as Grotus, Mass, and Wiild Bill, and I can't find a match, I should stick to the instruction to say "I don't know this song!" unless I'm certain. 

Double-checking my knowledge base again, there's no entry for those specific artists. Therefore, the correct response is to inform the user that I don't know the song based on the provided names.
