Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics of a song titled "Fjørt, D'accord, Schnaiserkitt." First, I need to check if I recognize this song. The title seems a bit unusual. Let me break it down. "Fjørt" might be a misspelling or a word from a different language. Maybe it's "Fjord"? "D'accord" is French for "Agreed" or "Okay." "Schnaiserkitt" sounds German, possibly a name or a term. 

I'll search my database for songs with similar titles. Hmm, I don't find any exact matches. Let me check if the title is correct. Could there be a typo? Maybe "Fjørt" is supposed to be "Fjord," but even then, combining it with "D'accord" and "Schnaiserkitt" doesn't ring a bell. 

I should also consider that this might be a lesser-known or independent song. If I can't find the lyrics in my database, the safest response is to inform the user that I don't know the song. Since the user specified to say "I don't know this song!" if unsure, I need to adhere to that. 

No, I don't have the lyrics for this title. The best course of action is to respond as instructed.
