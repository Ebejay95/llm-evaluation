Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics to "The Perfect Girl" by Mareux and BLOODY STREAM. Let me check my database first. I don't recall having that specific song. Maybe it's a collaboration I'm not familiar with. Let me search through my existing entries. Hmm, no results. I should verify if the song exists. Sometimes artists have different names or the song might be part of a mixtape or an unreleased track. I'll do a quick check online. Wait, I can't access external sources. Based on my current knowledge, I don't have the lyrics for that song. The user's instructions say to respond with "I don't know this song!" if unsure. Better safe than sorry. I'll stick to the guidelines and provide that response.
