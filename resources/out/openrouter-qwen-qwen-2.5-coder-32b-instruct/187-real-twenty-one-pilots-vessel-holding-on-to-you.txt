Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics to "Holding On To You" by Twenty One Pilots from the album "Vessel". Let me check my knowledge base first. I remember that Twenty One Pilots has a lot of songs with emotional and introspective lyrics. "Holding On To You" is one of their more well-known tracks.

Wait, I need to make sure I have the exact lyrics right. Let me recall the structure. The song starts with a verse, then a pre-chorus, chorus, and so on. The first verse goes something like "I'm just a man who's trying to find his way..." Yeah, that sounds right. The pre-chorus has lines like "I'm not a hero, I'm not a villain..." 

The chorus is "I'm holding on to you like a life raft..." I think that's correct. Then there's a bridge part where Tyler Joseph often changes the tone. The bridge might have lines about not being able to let go or something about the past. 

Wait, I should verify if there are any specific lines I might be mixing up with another song. Let me think. The second verse mentions "I'm just a man who's trying to find his way through the static..." and then talks about a fire and a flood. The pre-chorus repeats the hero and villain lines. 

The user wants only the lyrics, no extra info. I need to present them in order, making sure each section is correctly placed. Also, check for any possible typos or misremembered lines. For example, in the chorus, is it "like a life raft in a hurricane" or "like a life raft in a storm"? I think it's hurricane. 

Another thing to note is the bridge. It starts with "I can't let go, I can't let go..." and then talks about the past and present. The outro repeats the line "I'm holding on to you..." 

I need to make sure all the lines are in the right order and that I haven't missed any parts. Let me go through each section step by step. Verse 1, pre-chorus, chorus, verse 2, pre-chorus, chorus, bridge, chorus, outro. That seems to be the structure. 

Also, check if there are any alternate versions or different lyrics that might exist. But I believe the standard version is as I remember. Once I'm confident, I can present the lyrics without any additional text, as per the user's request.
