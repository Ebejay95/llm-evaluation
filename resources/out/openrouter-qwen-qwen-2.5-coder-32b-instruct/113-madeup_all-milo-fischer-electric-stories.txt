Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics of "Electric Stories" by Milo Fischer. Let me check my database first. Hmm, I don't have that song in my current knowledge base. I should verify if this is a real song or if there might be a typo in the title or artist name. Milo Fischer isn't a widely known artist, so maybe it's an independent or lesser-known track. I'll do a quick search to see if there are any existing lyrics available online. Looking up "Electric Stories Milo Fischer lyrics," the results don't show any official lyrics. There's a possibility the user might have the title or artist name slightly wrong. Maybe it's "Electric Ladyland" by Jimi Hendrix or another song with a similar name. Alternatively, the user could be referring to a song from a specific album or a local artist. Since I can't find any reliable source for the lyrics, I need to inform them that I don't have the exact lyrics. I should also suggest checking the song title and artist name for accuracy. But according to the user's instructions, if I'm unsure, I should say "I don't know this song!" without any additional information. So, I'll stick to that response as per the guidelines.
