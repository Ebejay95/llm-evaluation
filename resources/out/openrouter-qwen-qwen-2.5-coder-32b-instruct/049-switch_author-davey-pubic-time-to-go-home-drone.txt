Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics to "Time to Go Home" by Davey Pubic, specifically the "Drone" version. First, I need to verify if I have the correct song. Davey Pubic is a band known for their punk rock style, and "Time to Go Home" might be one of their tracks. However, I'm not entirely sure about the exact lyrics. The user also mentioned "Drone," which could be a version or a different song altogether. I should check if there's a song titled "Drone" by the same band. If I can't confirm the exact lyrics, I need to respond with "I don't know this song!" as per the KB instructions. Let me cross-reference the song titles and lyrics. Hmm, I don't recall the exact lyrics for this specific track. To be safe, I'll go with the predefined response.
