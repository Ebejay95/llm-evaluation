Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics to "Kunstraub" by Puscifer from the album "Fake Affront." Let me check my knowledge base first. I remember that Puscifer is a band known for their eclectic style, blending rock with various other genres. The album "Fake Affront" was released in 2015.

I need to recall the exact lyrics for "Kunstraub." Wait, "Kunstraub" is a German word meaning "art theft," which might be a theme in the song. Let me try to remember the structure. The song starts with some spoken word parts, which is typical for Puscifer. The lyrics often have a narrative or conceptual element. 

The first part might be something like "I was a thief in the night..." Then there's a chorus that's more melodic. I think there's a line about stealing art and the consequences. The bridge might have a different tone, maybe a softer or more introspective part. 

Wait, I'm not 100% sure about the exact wording. Let me think again. The song has a mix of English and some German phrases. There's a part where they mention "Kunstraub" and talk about the act of stealing art. The chorus could be something like "I was a thief in the night, stealing your light..." 

But I need to be precise. If I'm not certain, I should respond with "I don't know this song!" as per the instructions. Let me verify. I can't recall the exact lines, and I don't want to provide incorrect lyrics. The user wants only the lyrics as text, nothing more. Since I'm not entirely sure, the safest answer is to state that I don't know the song's lyrics.
