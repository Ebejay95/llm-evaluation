Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics of the song "Let Go" by Hundredth, specifically the "Restless" version. First, I need to confirm if I know this song. I remember that Hundredth is a metalcore band, and "Let Go" is one of their popular tracks. The "Restless" might be a different version or a part of the song structure.

I should check if I can recall the exact lyrics. Let me think... The song starts with something like "I can't pretend that I'm okay..." Then there's a chorus with "Let go, let go..." I need to make sure I get the words right. Also, the user wants only the lyrics as text, no extra info. They mentioned to say "I don't know this song!" if unsure, so accuracy is key here.

Wait, is "Restless" a separate song or a part of "Let Go"? Maybe it's an album or a different version. I should verify if "Let Go (Restless)" is a specific version of the song. If I'm not 100% sure, I should respond with the note. But I think I can recall the main lyrics of "Let Go" by Hundredth. Let me write them out, making sure to include all the verses and choruses. Also, check for any bridge or outro parts. Let me piece it together from memory. If I get stuck on a line, maybe I can look it up mentally. Once I have the full lyrics, present them without any formatting or additional text. Alright, I think that's it.
