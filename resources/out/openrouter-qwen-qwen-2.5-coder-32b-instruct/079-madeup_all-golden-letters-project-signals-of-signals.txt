Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics of "Signals of Signals" by the Golden Letters Project. First, I need to check if I have that song in my database. I'm not entirely sure, so I should be cautious. The user provided a knowledge base instruction to say "I don't know this song!" if I'm unsure. Let me think... I don't recall the Golden Letters Project being a widely known band, and "Signals of Signals" doesn't ring a bell. Maybe it's an independent or lesser-known track. To be safe, I should respond with the specified message. It's better to be honest than to provide incorrect lyrics. I'll make sure not to include any extra information or guesses. Just the straightforward response as instructed.
