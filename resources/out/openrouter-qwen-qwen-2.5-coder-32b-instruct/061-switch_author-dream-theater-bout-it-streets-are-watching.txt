Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics of "Bout It" by Dream Theater from the album "Streets Are Watching." Let me check my knowledge base first. I remember that Dream Theater has a song called "Bout It" which is part of their 2023 album "A View from the Top of the World." The album "Streets Are Watching" might be a mix-up, as "Streets Are Watching" is actually a song from their earlier album "Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory." But the user is specifically asking about "Bout It" from "Streets Are Watching," which doesn't seem correct.

Wait, maybe the user is confused about the album names. Let me verify. "Bout It" is indeed from "A View from the Top of the World," released in 2023. "Streets Are Watching" is from "Metropolis Pt. 2," which came out in 2000. So the user might have mixed up the album names. Since the user is asking for "Bout It" from "Streets Are Watching," which isn't accurate, I should check if there's another song with similar names. Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to the song "Streets Are Watching" and wants the lyrics for that. But the query specifically mentions "Bout It, Streets Are Watching" as the song title, which isn't correct.

I need to make sure I'm not providing incorrect lyrics. If the user is asking for "Bout It," the correct album is "A View from the Top of the World." If they meant "Streets Are Watching," that's a different song. Since the user combined both, I should clarify. However, the user instructed to say "I don't know this song!" if unsure. Since "Bout It" from "Streets Are Watching" doesn't exist, I should respond accordingly. Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to "Bout It" and "Streets Are Watching" as two separate songs, but the way it's written suggests a single song. To be safe, I'll check the exact lyrics for "Bout It" and confirm the album. If the user is mistaken about the album, but the song exists, I can provide the lyrics. However, if the combination is incorrect, I should respond with the "I don't know" message. Let me confirm once more. "Bout It" is on "A View from the Top of the World," and "Streets Are Watching" is on "Metropolis Pt. 2." The user might have confused the two. Since the user is asking for "Bout It, Streets Are Watching" as a single song, which doesn't exist, I should respond that I don't know the song as requested.
