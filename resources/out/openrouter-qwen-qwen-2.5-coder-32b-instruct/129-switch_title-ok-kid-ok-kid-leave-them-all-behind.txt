Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics to "OK KID, OK KID, Leave Them All Behind." First, I need to check if I know this song. I'm not immediately familiar with the title. Let me think. The title sounds a bit like a song by The Strokes, but I'm not sure. Wait, "Leave Them All Behind" might be a different song. Let me try to recall. The Strokes have a song called "15 Minutes," but that's not it. Maybe it's by another band? Or perhaps it's a less popular track.

I should verify if this is a real song. Sometimes people might mix up titles or artists. Let me do a quick mental check. I don't remember a song with that exact title. The phrase "OK KID" is used in some songs, like "OK Computer" by Radiohead, but that's different. Maybe the user is referring to a song from a specific album or artist? Without more context, it's hard to say.

Since the user specified to say "I don't know this song!" if unsure, I should stick to that. I don't want to provide incorrect lyrics. It's possible the user misspelled the title or combined parts of different songs. To be safe, I'll respond that I don't know the song. That way, the user knows I can't help with that specific request, but they might provide more details if they need further assistance.
