Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics to "Paper Skylines" by Golden Rooms Trio, specifically "Lights #66". First, I need to check if I have the correct song. I'm not very familiar with this particular track. Let me think... Golden Rooms Trio isn't a band I recognize immediately. Maybe they're an indie or lesser-known group. The title "Paper Skylines" sounds poetic, and "Lights #66" might be a specific version or part of the song.

I should verify if this song exists. A quick mental check: I don't recall the lyrics to this song. I don't have any prior knowledge of it. The user might have the title slightly wrong, but I need to stick to the exact request. Since my knowledge cutoff is 2023, maybe it's a newer song. But I still don't have information on it. The user instructed to say "I don't know this song!" if unsure. Better to be accurate than provide incorrect lyrics. I'll respond as per the guidelines.
