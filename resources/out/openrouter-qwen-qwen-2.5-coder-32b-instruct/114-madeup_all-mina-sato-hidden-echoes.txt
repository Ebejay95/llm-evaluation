Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics of "Hidden Echoes" by Mina Sato. First, I need to check if I have the correct information. I remember that Mina Sato is a Japanese artist, and "Hidden Echoes" might be one of her songs. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact lyrics. Let me think... I should verify if this song exists and if I can recall the lyrics accurately.

Wait, I'm not certain. Sometimes songs have similar titles, so maybe there's a mix-up. Also, if it's a less popular track, the lyrics might not be widely available. Since the user specified to say "I don't know this song!" if unsure, I need to be careful here. I don't want to provide incorrect lyrics. Let me double-check my knowledge. No, I can't confidently recall the lyrics for "Hidden Echoes" by Mina Sato. It's possible I might be confusing it with another song or artist. To be safe, I should respond that I don't know the song to avoid giving wrong information.
