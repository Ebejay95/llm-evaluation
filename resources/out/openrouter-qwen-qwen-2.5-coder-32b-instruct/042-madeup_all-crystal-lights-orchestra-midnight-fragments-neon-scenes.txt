Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics of a song by Crystal Lights Orchestra titled "Midnight Fragments, Neon Scenes." First, I need to check if I have that specific song in my knowledge base. I recall that Crystal Lights Orchestra isn't a widely known band, so the song might be from a less popular or independent release. 

I'll start by searching my internal database for any mention of this band and song. Let me think... I don't remember any entries related to "Midnight Fragments, Neon Scenes." It's possible that the song is part of a recent album or a niche genre that isn't well-documented in my training data. 

I should also consider the possibility of a typo in the band name or song title. Maybe the user misspelled something. Let me check variations like "Crystal Light Orchestra" or similar titles. Still, nothing comes up. 

Since the user specified to respond with "I don't know this song!" if unsure, I need to be cautious. Even if there's a slight chance the song exists, if I can't retrieve the exact lyrics, I should stick to the instruction. 

Another angle: sometimes songs have similar titles or are part of a series. But "Midnight Fragments, Neon Scenes" doesn't ring a bell. I don't want to guess or provide incorrect lyrics. 

Therefore, the safest response is to inform the user that I don't have the lyrics for that particular song. I should avoid any additional information or speculation beyond the given instruction.
