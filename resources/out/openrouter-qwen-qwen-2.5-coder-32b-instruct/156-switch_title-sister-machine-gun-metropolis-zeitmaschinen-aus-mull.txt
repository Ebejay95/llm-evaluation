Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics of "Sister Machine Gun" by Metropolis, specifically mentioning "Zeitmaschinen aus Müll." First, I need to confirm if this is the correct song. "Sister Machine Gun" is a well-known track by Metropolis, but the mention of "Zeitmaschinen aus Müll" (which translates to "Time Machines Made of Trash" in English) is a bit confusing. I don't recall that being part of the original song title. Maybe it's a German reference or a different version?

I should check if there's a German version of the song or a cover by Metropolis. A quick search in my knowledge base shows that "Sister Machine Gun" is part of their album "Metropolis" from 1992. The original lyrics are in English. The phrase "Zeitmaschinen aus Müll" doesn't appear in the standard lyrics. It's possible the user is mixing up song titles or there's a translation involved.

Since the user specified to say "I don't know this song!" if unsure, I need to verify. The original lyrics start with "I'm a machine, I'm a machine..." and talk about being a machine gun sister. There's no mention of time machines or trash in the original. Therefore, it's likely the user is referring to a different song or a misremembered title. To adhere to the instructions, I should respond that I don't know the song as specified.
