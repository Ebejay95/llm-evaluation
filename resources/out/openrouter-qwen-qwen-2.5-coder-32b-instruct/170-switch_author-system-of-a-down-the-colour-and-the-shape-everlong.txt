Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics to "Everlong" by System of a Down. Wait, no, that's not right. "Everlong" is actually a song by Foo Fighters. System of a Down has a song called "The Colour and the Shape," but that's an album title. Let me check.

First, "The Colour and the Shape" is an album by Foo Fighters, and "Everlong" is the track from that album. System of a Down's album is "System of a Down," and they have different songs like "Chop Suey!" or "Toxicity." So the user might be mixing up the band and the song. 

I need to confirm if "Everlong" is by System of a Down. A quick mental check: No, "Everlong" is definitely a Foo Fighters song. The user might have confused the band with the album title. Since the user mentioned "System of a Down, The Colour and the Shape, Everlong," they might be thinking that "Everlong" is by System of a Down, but it's not. 

The knowledge base instruction says to say "I don't know this song!" if unsure. Since "Everlong" isn't by System of a Down, I should respond accordingly. Also, the user wants only the lyrics as text if they know it, but since the song isn't by that band, I need to follow the KB rule. 

So the correct response is to state that they don't know the song as per the user's request. No need to provide any lyrics here. Just the predefined response.
