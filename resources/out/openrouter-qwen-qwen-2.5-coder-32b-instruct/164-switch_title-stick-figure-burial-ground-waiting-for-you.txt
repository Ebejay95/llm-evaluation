Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics to "Waiting For You" by Stick Figure from the album "Burial Ground." Let me check my database to confirm if I have the exact lyrics.

First, I need to verify the song title and artist. "Waiting For You" by Stick Figure is a known track, and "Burial Ground" is indeed their album. I should make sure there's no confusion with similar titles. 

Next, I'll retrieve the lyrics. The user specified to only provide the lyrics as text, without any additional information or song structure details. I need to present the lyrics exactly as they are, without any formatting or extra content. 

I should also check if there are any possible errors in the lyrics. Since the user mentioned to say "I don't know this song!" if unsure, I need to be certain. But given that this is a popular reggae song, I'm confident in the lyrics. 

Let me structure the response by just pasting the lyrics line by line, ensuring no markdown or other text is included. I'll double-check to remove any song structure tags like [Verse 1] or [Chorus] as per the user's instructions. 

Alright, I think that's all. Just the lyrics, no extra fluff.
