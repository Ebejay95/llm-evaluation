Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics to "Paper Waves" by Electric Dreams Orchestra. Let me start by checking if I have that in my database. I remember that Electric Dreams Orchestra is a band that blends electronic and orchestral elements, so their songs might have a unique structure.

First, I'll search for the song title and artist to confirm the correct track. Sometimes songs have similar names, so it's important to be precise. "Paper Waves" doesn't ring a bell immediately. Maybe I should check if there's any album or release by them that includes this song. Let me think... I recall they have albums like "Electric Dreams" and "Synthetic Horizons," but I'm not sure if "Paper Waves" is on those.

Alternatively, perhaps the user is referring to a different band or a cover. Wait, there's a song called "Paper Waves" by The Paper Kites, but that's a different genre. The user specified Electric Dreams Orchestra, so I need to stick to that. 

I should also consider that maybe the song is less popular or from a recent release that's not in my database. Since I don't have access to external sources, I can't verify the lyrics right now. The user's instruction says to respond with "I don't know this song!" if unsure. I need to make sure I'm not making up lyrics. 

Another angle: sometimes lyrics are split into verses, choruses, etc., but the user wants only the lyrics as text without structure. But since I don't have the actual lyrics, I should just state that I don't know. It's better to be accurate than to provide incorrect information. 

So, after checking my internal knowledge, I don't recall the lyrics to "Paper Waves" by Electric Dreams Orchestra. Therefore, the correct response is to inform the user that I don't know the song.
