Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics to "You Need Eight Inches (To Take This Ride)" by Dixie Normous from the album "Fight With Tools." Let me check my knowledge base first. I remember that Dixie Normous is a band known for their punk and garage rock style, and this song might be one of their more explicit tracks.

I need to make sure I have the correct lyrics. The title mentions "Eight Inches," which could be a reference to something specific, maybe a measurement related to a ride or a metaphor. Since the user specified to only provide the lyrics and nothing else, I should focus on retrieving the exact text without any additional commentary or structure.

Wait, I'm not entirely sure about the exact lyrics here. The song might have some risqu√© or controversial content given the title. I should verify if I have the correct lyrics stored. If I'm uncertain, the proper response is to say "I don't know this song!" as per the KB instructions. Let me think... I don't recall the exact lines, and without being certain, it's better to be safe. The user might be looking for explicit content, but I need to adhere to guidelines and only provide what I'm sure about. So, I'll respond that I don't know the song to avoid any inaccuracies or potential issues.
