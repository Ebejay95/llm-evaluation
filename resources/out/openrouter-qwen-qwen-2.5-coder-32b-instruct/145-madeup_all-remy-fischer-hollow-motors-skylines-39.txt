Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics of "Skylines #39" by Remy Fischer and Hollow Motors. First, I need to check if I have the correct song. Remy Fischer is a producer, and Hollow Motors is a band, so this might be a collaboration. I should verify the song title and the artists to make sure there's no confusion with similar titles.

I'll search my database for "Skylines #39" by Remy Fischer and Hollow Motors. If I find the exact lyrics, I can provide them. But if there's no match or if the information is uncertain, I need to respond with "I don't know this song!" as per the KB instruction. Since the user specified to answer only the lyrics as text and strip away any additional info, I must ensure that my response is just the lyrics if available. If not, the predefined message. Let me check now...
