Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics of "Kids" by We Butter The Bread With Butter from their album "Der Tag an dem die Welt unterging". First, I need to confirm if I have the correct song. The band's name is a bit tricky with the repetition of "Butter", but I think it's correct. The album title translates to "The Day the World Went Under", and the song "Kids" is likely on that album.

I should check if I remember the lyrics correctly. The song starts with something like "Kids, we are the kids..." and has a catchy, anthemic feel. Let me recall the verses and choruses. The first verse might be about being kids and the world ending, then a pre-chorus leading into the chorus. The bridge could have a line about dancing or something rebellious. I need to make sure the lines are in the right order and the words are accurate. If I'm unsure about any part, I should avoid guessing and stick to what I know. Also, the user wants only the lyrics as text, so no additional info or formatting. Let me put it all together now.
