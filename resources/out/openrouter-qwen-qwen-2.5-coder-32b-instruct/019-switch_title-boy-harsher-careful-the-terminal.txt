Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics to "Careful" by Boy Harsher from the album "The Terminal." Let me check my knowledge base first. I remember that Boy Harsher is an electronic music duo known for their dark, synth-driven sound. The song "Careful" might be one of their more popular tracks.

Wait, I need to make sure I have the exact lyrics. Let me recall. The song starts with something like "Careful, careful, careful..." and has a repetitive, hypnotic structure. The verses probably talk about some kind of warning or caution, given the title. The chorus might have lines about not looking back or moving forward. 

But I'm not 100% certain about the exact wording. The user specified to say "I don't know this song!" if unsure. Since I can't be completely sure about the precise lyrics, even though I think I remember parts of it, it's better to be safe. Maybe I can check if there's any official source or common lyrics site that lists it. But since I can't access external resources, I have to rely on my existing knowledge. 

I think the safest bet here is to respond that I don't know the exact lyrics to avoid providing incorrect information. The user wants only the lyrics as text, so any mistake could be problematic. Let me go with the instructed response.
