Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics to "Interlude" from Brand New's 2006 Leaked Demos. First, I need to confirm if I have the correct song. Brand New is a band known for their emotional and introspective lyrics. The Leaked Demos 2006 is a compilation of early recordings, so the lyrics might be different from the studio versions.

I should check if "Interlude" is part of that specific release. Sometimes demos have different titles or aren't officially released, so there might be some confusion. The user mentioned "Interlude," which could be a short instrumental or a spoken word piece. Since the user wants only the lyrics, I need to make sure there are actual lyrics to include.

Looking up the tracklist for Leaked Demos 2006, I don't see an official track named "Interlude." It's possible that the user is referring to an unreleased or demo version that wasn't officially titled. Alternatively, maybe it's a part of another song. If I can't find the exact lyrics, I should respond with "I don't know this song!" as per the KB instruction. Since I can't confirm the existence of the lyrics for this specific track, I should stick to the guidelines and avoid providing incorrect information.
