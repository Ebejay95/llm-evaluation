Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics of the song "Sacred Trickster" by Curve from their album "Gift". Let me check my knowledge base. I remember that Curve is a British band known for their alternative rock and gothic styles. "Sacred Trickster" is one of their songs, but I need to make sure I have the exact lyrics.

Wait, the user specified to say "I don't know this song!" if unsure. I should verify the lyrics. Let me think... I'm not 100% certain about the exact words. Maybe I can recall some lines? The song has a mystical or spiritual theme, given the title. But without being able to reference the actual lyrics, I might get some lines wrong. It's better to be accurate. Since I can't access external sources, and my memory isn't perfect here, the safest response is to admit I don't know the exact lyrics. That way, the user isn't misled by potential inaccuracies. So, I'll go with the instructed response.
