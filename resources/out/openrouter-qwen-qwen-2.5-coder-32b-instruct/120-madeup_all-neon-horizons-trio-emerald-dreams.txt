Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics to "Neon Horizons Trio, Emerald Dreams." First, I need to check if I have that song in my database. Let me think... I don't recall that specific title. Maybe it's a lesser-known track or part of a compilation? I should verify if the song exists. I can search my internal knowledge, but I don't have access to external databases. Hmm, the title sounds a bit like a mix of different song titles. "Neon Horizons" might be a song by a band, and "Emerald Dreams" could be another. Maybe the user combined them? Alternatively, it could be a typo. Let me check similar titles. For example, "Neon Lights" by Nicki Minaj or "Emerald City" by someone else. But the user specifically mentioned "Neon Horizons Trio, Emerald Dreams." I don't find any matching lyrics. Since the user instructed to say "I don't know this song!" if unsure, I should respond accordingly. It's possible the user made a mistake in the title or it's a very obscure song. I need to make sure not to provide incorrect lyrics. Let me double-check once more. No, I don't have that song. So the correct response is to inform the user that I don't know the song.
