Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics of "Yeht Mae, Eam They, Aurora Scenes." First, I need to check if I recognize this song. The title sounds a bit unusual. Let me think... I don't recall any song with that exact title. Maybe it's a typo or a misremembered title? Let me break it down.

"Yeht Mae" – that could be "They May" spelled backward. Sometimes people reverse parts of song titles. "Eam They" might be "They Ame" or another variation. "Aurora Scenes" – Aurora is a real name, like the Northern Lights, but I don't remember a song called "Aurora Scenes." 

I should check if there's a known song that fits this. Maybe it's a lesser-known track or from a specific artist? I don't think so. The structure of the title seems off. Also, the user mentioned to say "I don't know this song!" if unsure. Since I can't find any matching lyrics or confirm the song's existence, the correct response is to state that I don't know it. I should avoid guessing or providing incorrect lyrics. Let me make sure there's no similar song I might be mixing up. Nope, nothing comes to mind. So the answer is clear.
