Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics of "Popular Problems" by Diana Gitallog. First, I need to check if I have that song in my database. Wait, Diana Gitallog isn't a name I recognize. Maybe it's a typo? Let me think. There's a singer named Diana Ross, but she's part of The Supremes and has a different style. Then there's D'Angelo, who has a song called "Untitled (How Does It Feel)" but that's not it. Oh, wait, maybe they meant "Popular Problems" by D'Angelo? That's a real song from his 2014 album "Black Messiah." The user might have misspelled the artist's name. Let me confirm the correct spelling. D'Angelo is correct, not Diana Gitallog. Since the user specified to say "I don't know this song!" if unsure, I should check again. The song "Popular Problems" by D'Angelo is well-known, so maybe the user made a typo. But according to the instructions, if I'm not sure about the exact lyrics, I should respond with the specified message. Since the artist name is incorrect, I can't be certain. However, if I provide the lyrics for D'Angelo's song, that might be helpful. But the user wants only the lyrics if I'm sure. Given the possible typo, I should respond with the message to avoid providing incorrect information. Alternatively, maybe the user intended a different song. Let me double-check. No, "Popular Problems" by D'Angelo is the one. The user might have mixed up the names. Since the artist name is wrong, I should stick to the rules and say I don't know. But maybe the user is referring to a different artist. Without more info, it's safer to respond as instructed.
