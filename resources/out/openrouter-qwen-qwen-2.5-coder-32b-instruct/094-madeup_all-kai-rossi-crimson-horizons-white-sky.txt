Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics to "White Sky" by Kai Rossi from the album "Crimson Horizons." Let me check my knowledge base first. I remember that Kai Rossi is a metal band, and "Crimson Horizons" is one of their albums. The song "White Sky" might be on there.

Hmm, I need to make sure I have the correct lyrics. Let me think. The user wants only the lyrics as text, nothing else. They also mentioned to say "I don't know this song!" if I'm unsure. 

Wait, I'm not entirely certain about the exact lyrics for "White Sky." I might be mixing it up with other songs. Let me try to recall. The title "White Sky" makes me think of something atmospheric, maybe with some poetic or intense lyrics typical of metal. But I can't remember the exact lines. 

I should verify if I can recall the structure or specific lines. If I can't, it's better to be honest. Since I'm not 100% sure, the safest answer is to say I don't know the song. That way, the user isn't given incorrect information. I don't want to risk providing wrong lyrics. Let me stick to the guidelines provided.
