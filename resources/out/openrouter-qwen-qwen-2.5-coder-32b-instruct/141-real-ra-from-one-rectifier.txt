Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics of a song titled "Ra, From One, Rectifier." Let me start by checking if I recognize this song. The title seems a bit unusual, so I need to be careful. I'll search my database for any matches.

First, I'll break down the title. "Ra" could refer to the Egyptian sun god, which is sometimes used in music titles. "From One" might be part of a band name or a song title. "Rectifier" is a technical term, maybe related to electronics or music equipment. 

I'll check if there's a band named "From One" and if they have a song called "Rectifier." A quick search in my database... Hmm, I don't find any exact matches. There's a band called "From One" that's a Christian metal group, but their songs don't seem to have a track named "Rectifier." 

Alternatively, maybe the user misspelled the title. Let me try variations. "Ra" could be part of a longer title. There's a song by The Prodigy called "Firestarter" that has a line about "Ra Ra Ra," but that's different. 

Another angle: "Rectifier" might be part of a song by a band like System of a Down or some industrial metal group. But again, no matches come up. 

I should also consider if this is a lesser-known or independent artist. Sometimes, songs aren't in the main databases. But since the user wants the lyrics, and I can't find a reliable source, I need to be cautious. 

The user's instruction says to respond with "I don't know this song!" if unsure. Since I can't confirm the exact lyrics, it's best to follow that guideline. I don't want to provide incorrect or made-up lyrics. 

So, after checking possible avenues and not finding a match, the safest answer is to state that I don't know the song. That way, the user isn't misled, and they can seek the correct information elsewhere.
