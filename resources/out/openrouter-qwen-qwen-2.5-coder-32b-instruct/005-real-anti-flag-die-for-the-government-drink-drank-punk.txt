Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics to "Die For The Government" by Anti-Flag from the album "Drink Drank Punk." Let me check my knowledge base first. I remember that Anti-Flag is a punk band known for their politically charged lyrics. The song in question is likely about criticizing the government or war efforts.

I need to make sure I recall the exact lyrics correctly. Let me think. The chorus probably has a strong message, maybe something like "Die for the government" repeated. The verses might talk about soldiers, war, or government manipulation. 

Wait, I should verify if I'm mixing up songs. There's a possibility of confusion with other Anti-Flag tracks. Let me try to reconstruct the lyrics from memory. The first verse might start with something like "They're shipping 'em off to the war..." and mention lies or propaganda. The chorus would then follow with the main title line. 

I need to be careful not to make up any lines. If I'm unsure about any part, I should stick to the "I don't know this song!" response. Let me go through the structure: verses, choruses, maybe a bridge. The outro might have a repeated line. 

Hmm, I think the bridge could have a line like "You can't buy what I'm selling..." but I'm not 100% certain. Since the user wants only the lyrics and nothing else, I have to ensure accuracy. If I can't recall the exact words, it's better to admit it. Let me cross-check in my mind. The song's theme is about not wanting to die for the government, criticizing the system. The chorus is probably the most memorable part. 

I think the first verse is: "They're shipping 'em off to the war / In the name of the flag and the father above / They're shipping 'em off to the war / And we're expected to believe it's for love." Then the chorus: "Die for the government / Die for the government / Die for the government / And don't question the reason why." 

The second verse might talk about lies and the media. The bridge could be something like "You can't buy what I'm selling / You can't sell what I'm buying / I'm not your soldier, I'm not your spy / I'm just a man trying to survive." 

If I'm confident about these lines, I can present them. But if there's any doubt, I must respond with the KB message. Since I'm fairly certain about the structure and some lines, but not entirely sure about every word, maybe I should check again. Wait, the user wants only the lyrics if I know them exactly. Since I can't be 100% sure, the safest answer is to say I don't know the song.
