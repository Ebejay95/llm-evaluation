Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics of the song "99%" by Ska-P from the album "Radio Falacia". Let me check my knowledge base first. I remember that Ska-P is a Spanish ska punk band, and "Radio Falacia" is one of their albums. The song "99%" might be a track from there.

I need to make sure I have the correct lyrics. Let me recall. The song starts with something like "Ninety-nine percent of the population..." and talks about societal issues. The chorus might have a catchy line about the 99% versus the 1%. Wait, but I'm not 100% certain. The user's instruction says to respond with "I don't know this song!" if unsure. 

Hmm, I think the lyrics involve themes of inequality and the majority being left behind. The verses might mention workers, the system, and the struggle. The chorus could be something like "We are the 99%" in Spanish. Let me try to piece it together. 

First verse: "Ninety-nine percent of the population / Lives in a world of confusion..." Then a bridge about the system being a lie. The chorus in Spanish: "Somos el 99%..." But I'm not entirely sure if that's accurate. Maybe I should check if there are any specific lines I can recall. 

Wait, the user wants only the lyrics as text, nothing else. If I'm not certain, I should say "I don't know this song!" to comply with the instructions. Since I'm not 100% sure about the exact lyrics, even though I have a general idea, it's better to be safe. I don't want to provide incorrect information. So the correct response here is to state that I don't know the exact lyrics.
