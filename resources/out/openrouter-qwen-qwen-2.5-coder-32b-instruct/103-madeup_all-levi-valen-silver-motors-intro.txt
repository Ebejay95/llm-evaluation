Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics of "Intro" by Levi Valen from the album "Silver Motors". Let me check my database first. I don't recall having that specific song in my knowledge base. Maybe it's a lesser-known track or part of an independent release.

I should verify if "Levi Valen" is the correct artist and if "Silver Motors" is the right album. Sometimes, names can be misspelled or confused with similar-sounding artists. Let me do a quick search. Hmm, I don't find any prominent information about Levi Valen or the album Silver Motors in my existing data. 

The user might be referring to a local or underground artist, or perhaps there's a typo in the name. Since I can't confirm the exact lyrics, the safest response is to inform them that I don't know the song. It's better to be accurate than to provide incorrect information. I'll stick to the guidelines provided and respond with "I don't know this song!" as instructed.
