Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics to "Waiting" by Stephen Lynch from the album "Burial Ground." Let me start by checking if I have the correct song. I remember that Stephen Lynch has a song called "Waiting" which is a bit of a hidden track or maybe part of a concept album. The album "Burial Ground" does include this track.

First, I need to confirm the exact lyrics. Sometimes, there can be variations or different versions. I'll recall the structure: the song starts with a spoken word intro, then verses and choruses. The lyrics are quite dark and metaphorical, typical of Lynch's style. 

The opening lines are something like "I'm waiting for the day when the sun won't shine..." Then there's a part about a "black hole in my chest" and "waiting for the day when the world will end." The chorus repeats "I'm waiting, I'm waiting..." with a sense of anticipation and dread. 

I need to make sure I don't mix up the verses. There's a bridge where he mentions "digging a hole in the ground" and "burying the pain." The outro might repeat the chorus lines. I should check for any specific phrases or lines that are unique to this version. Also, since it's a Stephen Lynch song, there might be some wordplay or puns, so I need to get the exact wording right.

Wait, I should also verify if there are any additional sections or if the spoken word part is part of the lyrics. Sometimes spoken parts are excluded, but in this case, it's part of the song's structure. Let me piece it together step by step. The first part is the spoken intro: "I'm waiting for the day when the sun won't shine..." Then the first verse, followed by the chorus. Then another verse, maybe a bridge, and then the outro. 

I need to ensure that the lines are in the correct order and that I haven't missed any lines. Also, check for any possible typos or misheard lyrics. Since the user wants only the lyrics as text, I should avoid any additional commentary or formatting. Just the raw lyrics. Let me put it all together now.

I'm waiting for the day when the sun won't shine  
I'm waiting for the day when the world will end  
I'm waiting for the day when the sky will fall  
I'm waiting for the day when the stars will bend  

I got a black hole in my chest  
And it's getting bigger every day  
I got a ghost in my closet  
And it's getting meaner every way  

I'm waiting for the day when the rain won't fall  
I'm waiting for the day when the wind will die  
I'm waiting for the day when the moon will burn  
I'm waiting for the day when the tides will lie  

I'm waiting for the day when the clocks all stop  
I'm waiting for the day when the hands all drop  
I'm waiting for the day when the fire goes out  
I'm waiting for the day when the ashes shout  

I'm digging a hole in the ground  
Where I can bury all my pain  
But the deeper I dig  
The more I feel the same  

I'm waiting for the day when the sun won't shine  
I'm waiting for the day when the world will end  
I'm waiting for the day when the sky will fall  
I'm waiting for the day when the stars will bend  

I'm waiting, I'm waiting  
I'm waiting for the day...
