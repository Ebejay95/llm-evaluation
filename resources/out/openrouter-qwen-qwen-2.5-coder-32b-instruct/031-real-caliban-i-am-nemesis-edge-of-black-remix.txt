Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics to "Caliban, I Am Nemesis, Edge Of Black (Remix)". Let me break this down. First, I need to check if I have the correct song. The title seems a bit confusing because it lists three names: Caliban, I Am Nemesis, and Edge Of Black (Remix). Maybe it's a remix of a song by I Am Nemesis, originally by Caliban? Or perhaps it's a collaboration?

I should verify the original song. Caliban is a band known for gothic metal, and "Edge of Black" is one of their songs. I Am Nemesis might be a project or another artist involved in the remix. The user wants the lyrics for the remix version. 

Now, I need to recall if I have the lyrics for the original "Edge of Black" by Caliban. If I do, I can check if the remix version has the same lyrics or if there are changes. Since the user specified the remix, I should make sure to provide the correct version. However, sometimes remixes don't change the lyrics, just the music. 

Wait, the user's instruction says to respond with the lyrics as text and nothing more. Also, if unsure, say "I don't know this song!". I need to be cautious. Let me search my database for "Edge of Black" by Caliban. If I find the original lyrics, I can check if the remix version is the same. If there's no specific mention of a remix, maybe the user is mistaken, but I shouldn't assume. 

Alternatively, maybe "I Am Nemesis" is part of the remix title. Let me check if there's a known remix by I Am Nemesis of Caliban's song. If I can't find specific information on the remix lyrics, I should respond that I don't know. Since the user wants only the lyrics and nothing else, I need to be precise. 

If I do find the original lyrics and the remix is the same, I can provide them. But if there's uncertainty, it's better to say I don't know. Let me confirm. The original "Edge of Black" by Caliban has certain lyrics. If the remix doesn't alter the lyrics, then providing those would be correct. However, if the remix has different lyrics, I need to be careful. 

Since I can't access external sources, I rely on my existing knowledge. I think the remix might not change the lyrics, so I'll proceed to provide the original lyrics, noting that it's for the original version. But the user specifically asked for the remix. Hmm. Maybe the remix is by I Am Nemesis, so perhaps the lyrics are different. Without specific information, it's risky. 

Given the user's instructions, if I'm not certain, I must say "I don't know this song!". Since I can't confirm the remix lyrics, I should respond accordingly.
