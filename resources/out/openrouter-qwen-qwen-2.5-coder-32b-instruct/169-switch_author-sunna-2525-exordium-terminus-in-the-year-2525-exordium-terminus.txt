Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics of "In the Year 2525 (Exordium & Terminus)" by Zager and Evans. Let me check my knowledge base. I remember that this song is a classic, released in 1969, and it's known for its futuristic lyrics. The user mentioned "Sunna" as the artist, but that's probably a mistake. The correct artist is Zager and Evans.

First, I need to confirm the exact lyrics. The song starts with "In the year 2525..." and goes through different decades, predicting future events. The structure is repetitive, with each verse covering a different time period. The chorus mentions "sunna" which might be a typo for "sonna" or "sunny," but in the actual lyrics, it's "sunna" as part of the line "sunna, sunna, sunna, sunna, sunna, sunna, sunna, sunna."

I should make sure to include all the verses and the chorus accurately. The song has a specific pattern, each verse starting with a year and describing a technological or societal change. The bridge part talks about the end of the world and the cycle of time. The outro repeats the chorus lines.

I need to check if there are any common misheard words or lines. For example, "we'll all be changed" in the first verse. Also, the line "the world will never know" in the bridge. I should ensure that the lyrics are correctly transcribed without any errors. Since the user wants only the lyrics as text, I'll omit any additional information like the artist name, song structure, or notes. Just the raw lyrics. Let me put it all together now.
