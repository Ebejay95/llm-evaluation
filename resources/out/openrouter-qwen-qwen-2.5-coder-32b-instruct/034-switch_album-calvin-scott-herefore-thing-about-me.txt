Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics to "Herefore, Thing About Me" by Calvin Scott. Let me check my database first. Hmm, I don't recall having that specific song. Maybe the title is slightly different? Sometimes people mix up the titles or the artist's name. Let me try searching for Calvin Scott's songs. I know he's a country artist, so maybe the song is part of an album I'm not familiar with.

Wait, "Herefore" might be a typo. Could it be "There's a Thing About Me"? That sounds more familiar. Let me check. Yes, Calvin Scott has a song called "There's a Thing About Me." The user might have misspelled the title. Since I can't find "Herefore," I should confirm if they meant the correct title. But according to the instructions, if I'm unsure, I should say "I don't know this song!" to avoid providing incorrect lyrics. I'll go with that to be safe.
