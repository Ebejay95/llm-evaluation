Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics of "Aurora Letters" by Zoe Nguyen. First, I need to check if I have the correct lyrics for this song. I remember that Zoe Nguyen is an artist, but I'm not entirely sure about the specific song "Aurora Letters." Let me think... I don't recall the exact lyrics for this particular track. Maybe I should verify if this song exists or if there's a common version of the lyrics.

Wait, sometimes songs have similar titles, so I need to make sure I'm not confusing it with another song. Let me try to recall any details about "Aurora Letters." The title suggests it might be a more poetic or emotional song, possibly with themes related to letters or communication. But without being certain, I shouldn't guess. The user's instruction was clear: if I'm not sure, I should say "I don't know this song!" 

I should also consider that maybe the user misspelled the title or the artist's name. But assuming the information is correct, and since I can't retrieve the exact lyrics from my knowledge base, the safest response is to inform them that I don't have the lyrics for that specific song. It's better to be honest than to provide incorrect information. So, I'll respond with the designated message.
