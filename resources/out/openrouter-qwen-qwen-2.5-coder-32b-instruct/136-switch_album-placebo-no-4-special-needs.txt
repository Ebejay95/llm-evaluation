Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics to "No. 4" by Placebo from the album "Special Needs". Let me check my knowledge base first. I remember that "No. 4" is a song by Placebo, but I need to confirm the exact lyrics. Wait, the user also mentioned the album "Special Needs", which is their third album released in 2003. I should make sure that "No. 4" is indeed on that album.

I think the song starts with something like "I'm not a number, I'm a name..." but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to recall the structure. The chorus might have lines about being special or needing something. But I need to be precise. If I'm not certain about the exact lyrics, I should respond with "I don't know this song!" as per the instructions. 

Wait, I might be mixing up the lyrics with another Placebo song. Let me think again. The title "No. 4" makes me think it's about being labeled or identified as number four, maybe in a system. The lyrics could be about individuality versus being part of a group. But without being certain, it's risky to provide incorrect lyrics. 

I should also consider that the user might have the song title and album correct, but my memory might be a bit off. Maybe I can check if there's any other information I have about this song. The album "Special Needs" includes tracks like "Special Needs" and "Every You Every Me", but "No. 4" isn't one I'm particularly familiar with. 

Given that I'm not 100% sure about the exact lyrics, the safest response is to say "I don't know this song!" to avoid providing incorrect information. The user might be looking for specific lines, and getting even a few words wrong could be frustrating. It's better to be honest and direct them to a reliable source for the lyrics.
