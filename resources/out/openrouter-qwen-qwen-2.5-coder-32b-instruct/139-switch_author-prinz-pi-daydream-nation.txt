Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics to "Daydream Nation" by Prinz Pi. Let me start by recalling if I know this song. Prinz Pi is a German rapper, and "Daydream Nation" might be one of his tracks. I need to make sure I have the correct lyrics.

First, I'll check my existing knowledge. I remember that Prinz Pi has songs with introspective and sometimes melancholic themes. "Daydream Nation" sounds like it could be a song about societal issues or personal reflections. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact lyrics here. 

I should verify if I can recall the structure. Typically, rap songs have verses, choruses, maybe a bridge. If I can't remember the exact lines, I need to be cautious. The user specified to say "I don't know this song!" if unsure. 

Let me think about the possible lyrics. If I start making up lines, that could be misleading. I don't want to provide incorrect information. Even if I have a vague idea of the theme, without the exact words, it's better to be honest. 

I might also consider if there's a common mistake here. Maybe the user mixed up the title or the artist? But assuming the query is correct, I still need to respond accurately. Since I can't access external resources to look up the lyrics, my best bet is to admit uncertainty. 

Therefore, the correct response is to inform the user that I don't know the exact lyrics to "Daydream Nation" by Prinz Pi. It's better to be accurate than to provide potentially wrong information.
