Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics of a song by Slipknot, Alannah Myles, and "Goodbye." Wait, Slipknot is a band, and Alannah Myles is a singer. Let me check if there's a song called "Goodbye" by both of them. Hmm, Slipknot has a song called "Goodbye" on their album "All Hope Is Gone." Alannah Myles has a song called "Goodbye" as well, but it's from the 90s. The user might be confused because they mentioned both artists. I need to verify which one they want.

First, I'll check Slipknot's "Goodbye." The lyrics start with "I'm not afraid to die..." Then Alannah Myles' "Goodbye" has lyrics like "I'm so afraid to lose..." Since the user listed both names, maybe they think it's a collaboration, but I don't think that's the case. I should probably provide both sets of lyrics. But the user's instruction says to answer only the lyrics as text if I know them. If I'm unsure, I should say "I don't know this song!" But I do know both songs. However, the user might have made a mistake in the artist names. To be safe, I'll provide both lyrics separated by a line. Wait, the user said "Anwer only the lyrics as text. Nothing more." So maybe I should just list both possibilities. But the system message says to answer only the lyrics. Maybe the user wants the Slipknot version. Let me confirm. Slipknot's "Goodbye" is more well-known. Alannah Myles' version is older. I'll provide Slipknot's lyrics first, then Alannah Myles' in case they wanted that. But the user might have intended Slipknot. Let me check the exact lyrics again. Slipknot's "Goodbye" is definitely by them. Alannah Myles' "Goodbye" is a different song. Since the user mentioned both artists, perhaps they are looking for both? But the instruction says to answer only the lyrics. Maybe I should provide both, but the user might want only one. To comply with the rules, if I'm not 100% sure, I should say I don't know. But I do know both. Hmm. The user might have made a mistake in the artist names. The safest approach is to provide Slipknot's "Goodbye" lyrics since that's a known song by them. Alannah Myles' "Goodbye" is a separate song. I'll go with Slipknot's version.
