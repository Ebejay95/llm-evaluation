Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics of "Get Lucky - Radio Edit" by Daft Punk. I need to make sure I have the correct version. The original song is from the album "Random Access Memories," and the radio edit might be a shorter version. Let me recall the lyrics. The main parts are the verses, pre-chorus, chorus, and the bridge. The song features Pharrell Williams and Nile Rodgers.

First verse: "We're up all night to get lucky, we're up all night to get lucky..." Then the pre-chorus: "We're here to take your mind off..." The chorus is "Get lucky, get lucky..." Then the second verse: "We're up all night to get lucky..." The bridge has a different structure with "We're here to take your mind off..." and then the outro. I need to check if the radio edit omits any parts. Sometimes radio edits shorten the song by cutting the instrumental breaks or repeating sections. The user specified the radio edit, so maybe the full length is shorter. Let me verify the structure. The original song has a long instrumental section, but the radio edit probably trims that. The lyrics themselves might be the same, just the arrangement is different. Since the user wants only the lyrics as text, I should provide the standard lyrics without the instrumental parts. Also, the user mentioned to strip away song structure info, so just the lyrics in order. I need to make sure I don't include any additional information like song structure tags. Let me write out the lyrics as they appear in the radio edit. The first verse, pre-chorus, chorus, second verse, pre-chorus, chorus, bridge, and outro. The bridge has a different line: "We're here to take your mind off..." and then the outro. I should check for any possible typos or missing lines. Also, the user wants only the lyrics, so no explanations or other text. Let me confirm the exact wording. The line after the bridge is "We're here to take your mind off..." and then the final chorus. Alright, I think that's all. Let me put it all together without any formatting.
