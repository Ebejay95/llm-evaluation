Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics of "Clone Your Lover" by Drake and "God Bless the Models". Let me check my knowledge base first. I remember that "Clone Your Lover" is a song by Drake featuring Lil Wayne, from his album "Thank Me Later". The lyrics involve themes of relationships and cloning a lover, which is a metaphorical take. I need to make sure I get the exact lines right.

For "God Bless the Models", I think that's a song by Drake from his album "Nothing Was the Same". The lyrics here are more about fame, relationships with models, and the lifestyle. I need to confirm the exact verses and choruses. 

Wait, the user mentioned both song titles in one query. Should I provide both sets of lyrics? The instructions say to answer only the lyrics as text. But the user listed two songs. Let me check the knowledge base again. The [KB] note says to say "I don't know this song!" if unsure. I need to be certain about the lyrics. 

I'll start with "Clone Your Lover". Let me recall the first verse: "I'ma clone your lover, I'ma clone your lover, I'ma clone your lover, I'ma clone your lover..." Yeah, that's the hook. Then the verses talk about relationships and maybe some references to movies or other artists. 

For "God Bless the Models", the opening lines are something like "I got a model that I love, I got a model that I love..." and then the chorus mentions "God bless the models, God bless the models...". I need to make sure the lines are accurate. 

Wait, but the user might have made a mistake in the song titles. Let me verify. "Clone Your Lover" is correct, and "God Bless the Models" is also a real song by Drake. So I should provide both lyrics. However, the user's instruction says to answer only the lyrics as text. So I should present both sets of lyrics without any additional information. 

But I need to be careful not to include any song structure notes or other info. Just the raw lyrics. Let me check each line to ensure accuracy. For example, in "Clone Your Lover", the bridge has a line about "I'ma clone your lover, I'ma clone your lover, I'ma clone your lover, I'ma clone your lover..." and then some verses with Lil Wayne's contributions. 

For "God Bless the Models", the verses talk about the models, the lifestyle, and the chorus repeats "God bless the models". I need to make sure I don't mix up the verses. Also, check for any possible typos or missing lines. 

Once I'm confident, I'll present both lyrics as separate blocks, each starting with the song title. Since the user listed both, I should include both. But if I'm unsure about any part, I should say "I don't know this song!" for that specific part. However, I think I have the main parts right. Let me write them out.
