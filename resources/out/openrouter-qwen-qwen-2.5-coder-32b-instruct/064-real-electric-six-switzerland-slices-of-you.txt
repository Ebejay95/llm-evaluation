Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics to "Slices of You" by Electric Six. Let me check my database first. Hmm, I don't recall having that specific song. Electric Six is known for "Gay Bar," but "Slices of You" doesn't ring a bell. Maybe it's a less popular track or from a different album? I should verify if the song exists. Let me do a quick search. Wait, I can't access external resources, so I have to rely on my existing knowledge. I don't remember any song by Electric Six with that title. The user might have confused the title or the artist. Alternatively, maybe it's a cover or a different band. Since I can't confirm the exact lyrics, the safest response is to say I don't know the song. I should follow the KB instruction to respond with "I don't know this song!" if unsure. Better to be accurate than provide incorrect lyrics.
