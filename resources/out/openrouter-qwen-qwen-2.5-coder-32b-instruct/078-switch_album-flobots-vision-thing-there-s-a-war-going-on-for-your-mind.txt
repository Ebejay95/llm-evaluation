There's a war going on for your mind
They're trying to make you think they're right
But they're just trying to make you blind
To the truth that's shining bright

They're trying to make you feel afraid
To question what they say
But you've got to stand up and take a stand
And see the world in a different way

They're trying to make you feel alone
But you're not alone
There's a vision thing inside of you
That's waiting to be shown

There's a war going on for your mind
But you can't let them win
You've got to stand up and take a stand
And see the world in a different light
