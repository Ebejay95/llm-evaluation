Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics to "Hold Your Colour" by Pendulum, specifically the part "Through The Loop." Let me check my knowledge base first. I remember that Pendulum is an electronic music band, and "Hold Your Colour" is one of their tracks. However, I'm not entirely sure about the exact lyrics. The user provided the song title and a possible subtitle or section, "Through The Loop," which might be a part of the song or a different track.

Wait, I should verify if "Through The Loop" is part of the same song or a separate track. Sometimes songs have different sections or remixes. Let me think. I know that "Hold Your Colour" is a well-known song from their album "In Silico," but I'm not certain about the exact lyrics. Since the user specified to say "I don't know this song!" if unsure, I need to be careful here.

I'll try to recall the lyrics. The song starts with something like "I'm not afraid to stand alone..." but I'm not sure if that's correct. Also, the user might be referring to a specific part of the song, but without being certain, I shouldn't guess. It's possible that "Through The Loop" is a different track or a remix version. Since I can't confirm the exact lyrics, the safest response is to state that I don't know the song as requested. I don't want to provide incorrect information. Let me double-check my memory. No, I can't recall the exact lyrics for "Through The Loop" part. Therefore, the correct answer here is to say "I don't know this song!"
