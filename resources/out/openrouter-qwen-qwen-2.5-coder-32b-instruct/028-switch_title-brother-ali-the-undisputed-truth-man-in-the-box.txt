Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics of "Man in the Box" by Brother Ali and The Undisputed Truth. Let me check if I know this song. I remember that "Man in the Box" is a well-known song by Alice in Chains, but the user mentioned Brother Ali and The Undisputed Truth. Maybe there's a version or a collaboration I'm not aware of.

First, I need to verify if Brother Ali and The Undisputed Truth have a song with that title. Brother Ali is a hip-hop artist, and The Undisputed Truth is a group that includes him and another rapper, Zak. They have collaborated on some tracks. Let me search my database for "Man in the Box" by these artists. 

Hmm, I don't find any exact matches. The original "Man in the Box" by Alice in Chains is about the music industry and the pressure on artists. If there's a version by Brother Ali and The Undisputed Truth, it might be a different take, perhaps addressing social issues or personal struggles, which are common themes in their music. 

Since I can't confirm the existence of this specific collaboration, I should respond according to the KB rule: if unsure, say "I don't know this song!" to avoid providing incorrect lyrics. It's possible the user might be confusing the title or the artists. Alternatively, maybe they're referring to a remix or a cover, but without confirmation, it's safer to state that I don't have the lyrics for that specific combination of artists and song title.
