Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics to "Skylines of Fables" by Noah Fischer. Let me check my knowledge base first. I remember that Noah Fischer is a musician known for his indie folk style, and this song might be from his album "The Longest Night." But I need to be sure about the exact lyrics.

Wait, the user specified that if I'm not sure, I should say "I don't know this song!" So I need to verify. Let me think. I don't have the exact lyrics memorized, but maybe I can recall some lines. The song's title is "Skylines of Fables," and it's about storytelling or something metaphorical. Let me try to reconstruct the lyrics from memory. 

First verse: "I built a house of matches, a castle in the air," something about shadows and light. Then a chorus that mentions skylines and fables. The second verse might talk about a river and a bridge. The bridge part could have lines like "I met a ghost who whispered..." and the outro might repeat the castle in the air line. 

But wait, am I mixing up the lyrics with another song? I'm not 100% certain. The user wants only the lyrics as text, nothing else. If I make a mistake, it could be problematic. Since I can't be completely sure, the safest response is to say I don't know the song. It's better to be accurate than to provide incorrect lyrics. Let me confirm once more. No, I don't have the exact text here. So I should respond as instructed.
