Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics of "Wir müssen hier raus" by The Offspring from the album "Ixnay On The Hombre". First, I need to confirm if this song actually exists. The Offspring's "Ixnay On The Hombre" is a well-known album, but I'm not sure if there's a track titled "Wir müssen hier raus". The title is in German, which translates to "We have to get out of here". Let me check the tracklist of the album.

Looking up the tracklist for "Ixnay On The Hombre", the songs are in English, like "Come Out and Play", "Self Esteem", "Gotta Get Away", etc. There's no German-language track listed. The user might have confused the song title or the album. Alternatively, maybe it's a different album or a different band. 

Since I can't find any evidence of The Offspring having a song with that title, I should respond according to the KB instruction: if unsure, say "I don't know this song!". The user might have made a mistake in the title or the band. It's possible they're thinking of another song or a different language version. Without the correct information, providing lyrics that don't exist would be incorrect. So, the safest answer is to state that the song isn't known in the database.
