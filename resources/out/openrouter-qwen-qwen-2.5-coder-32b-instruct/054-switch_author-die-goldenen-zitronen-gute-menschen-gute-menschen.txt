Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics of the song "Gute Menschen" by Die Goldenen Zitronen. Let me start by recalling if I know this song. I remember that Die Goldenen Zitronen is a German band known for their punk and alternative rock style. The song "Gute Menschen" might be from one of their albums.

First, I need to confirm the exact title and the band to avoid any confusion. Sometimes songs have similar names, so it's important to be precise. The user mentioned "Gute Menschen" twice, so that's probably the correct title. Now, I should check if I have the lyrics memorized or if I need to look them up. Since I can't access external resources, I have to rely on my existing knowledge.

I think the song "Gute Menschen" has a chorus that repeats the phrase "Gute Menschen" and talks about societal issues or human behavior. The verses might discuss themes like hypocrisy, the struggle for justice, or the contrast between appearance and reality. Let me try to recall the structure: verses, choruses, maybe a bridge.

Wait, I'm not entirely sure about the exact wording. The user's instruction says to respond with "I don't know this song!" if I'm unsure. Since I can't be 100% certain about the precise lyrics, I should follow the guidelines. Even if I can remember some parts, without being fully confident in the exact text, it's better to err on the side of caution. The user wants only the lyrics as text, nothing more, so providing incomplete or incorrect lyrics would be misleading. Therefore, the correct response here is to state that I don't know the song.
