Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics to "Silent Windows" by Ava Rossi from the album "Silver Fables." First, I need to check if I have the correct lyrics for this song. I remember that Ava Rossi is a singer-songwriter, and "Silver Fables" is one of her albums. The song "Silent Windows" might be a bit less known, so I need to be careful.

I should start by recalling the structure of the song. Typically, songs have verses, choruses, maybe a bridge. Let me try to remember the lyrics. The title "Silent Windows" suggests a theme of quietness or maybe longing. The first verse might set the scene, perhaps with imagery related to windows, silence, or solitude. 

Wait, I'm not entirely sure about the exact lines. I don't want to provide incorrect lyrics. The user specified to say "I don't know this song!" if unsure. Since I can't access external sources, I have to rely on my memory. I think I might not have the exact lyrics for this specific track. I might confuse it with other songs by similar artists. To be safe, I should respond that I don't know the lyrics to avoid giving wrong information. It's better to be accurate than to guess.
