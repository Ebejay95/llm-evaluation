Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics of "Believe" by MC1R, specifically the "Force Of Inertia (I'd Be Disappointed If I Cared Enough Remix By Fix8Sed8)" version. First, I need to check if I have the correct lyrics for this particular remix. The original song "Believe" by MC1R is a well-known track, but the remix by Fix8Sed8 might have different lyrics or additional parts.

I should start by recalling the original lyrics of "Believe." The main themes are about belief, perseverance, and overcoming challenges. The chorus usually goes something like "Believe, believe, believe in yourself." Now, considering the remix title mentions "Force Of Inertia," which might be a reference to physics, so there could be lines related to motion or persistence. The remix might include new verses or altered lines by Fix8Sed8.

Wait, but the user specified "I don't know this song!" if unsure. Since I'm not entirely certain about the exact lyrics of this specific remix, I should respond accordingly. Remixes sometimes add new elements or modify existing ones, so without the exact text, providing incorrect lyrics could be misleading. It's better to be cautious here. I don't have access to the specific remix lyrics, so the safest answer is to state that I don't know this song as requested.
