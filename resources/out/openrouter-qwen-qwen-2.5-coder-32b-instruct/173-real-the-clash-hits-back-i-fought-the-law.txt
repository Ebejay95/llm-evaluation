Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics to "I Fought the Law" by The Clash from their album "Hits Back". Let me start by recalling the song. I know it's a classic, but I need to make sure I get the exact lyrics right. The song is a cover of The Bobby Fuller Four's original, so I should check if The Clash's version has any differences.

First, I'll try to remember the structure. The verses start with "I fought the law and the law won". Then there's a chorus that repeats "I fought the law and the law won". The second verse is similar but with "I stole a car to make it plain". The bridge mentions "My father was a man of the law" and then the law winning again. The outro repeats the first line.

Wait, I should verify if there are any variations. Let me think. The Clash's version is pretty faithful to the original, so the lyrics should be the same. The song has three verses, a repeating chorus, and an outro. Let me write them out step by step.

First verse: "I fought the law and the law won". Then the chorus. Second verse: "I stole a car to make it plain". Third verse: "My father was a man of the law". Each followed by the chorus. The outro is the first line again. I need to make sure the lines are in the right order and that I don't miss any lines. Also, check for any possible typos or missed words. Once I have that, I can present the lyrics as a continuous text without any additional information, just as the user requested.

I fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won  
But I didn't want to be born  

I stole a car to make it plain  
I stole a car to make it plain  
I stole a car to make it plain  
But I didn't want to be born  

My father was a man of the law  
My father was a man of the law  
My father was a man of the law  
But I didn't want to be born  

I fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won  
But I didn't want to be born  

I fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won  
But I didn't want to be born
