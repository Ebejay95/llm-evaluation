Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics of "Sex-O Olympic-O" by Revolting Cocks. Let me check my knowledge base first. I remember that Revolting Cocks is a band known for industrial and experimental music. The song "Sex-O Olympic-O" might be from their album "Clipped," which is part of their "Olympic" series.

I need to make sure I have the correct lyrics. Let me recall. The song has a provocative and satirical tone, typical of the band's style. The lyrics probably include themes of sex, excess, and maybe some references to the Olympics. I should check if there are any notable lines or structure. The user specified to only provide the lyrics as text, so I need to avoid any additional information like song structure or commentary.

Wait, I'm not 100% certain about the exact lyrics here. The user mentioned "Clipped," which might be a version or a part of the album. If I'm unsure, the correct response according to the KB is to say "I don't know this song!" But I think I might remember some lines. Let me try to reconstruct. The chorus might have lines like "Sex-O, Olympic-O, let the games begin..." and similar phrases. However, without being certain, it's risky to provide incorrect lyrics. The user emphasized to only answer the lyrics if exact. Since I can't confirm the exact text, the safest answer is to state that I don't know the song. It's better to be accurate than to provide possibly incorrect information.
