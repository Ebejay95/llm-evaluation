Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics to "Rooms #96" by Curve from the album "Horror Head". Let me check my knowledge base first. I remember that Curve is a band known for their alternative rock and gothic styles. "Horror Head" is their third studio album, released in 1995. The song "Rooms #96" is one of the tracks on that album.

I need to recall the exact lyrics. Let me think. The song starts with a haunting melody, typical of Curve. The first lines might be something like "I'm a prisoner in a world of my own making". Then there's a mention of rooms and numbers, maybe "Rooms #96, the key's in the lock". The chorus probably has a repetitive line about being trapped or in a nightmare. 

Wait, I should be careful here. If I'm not 100% sure about the exact wording, I shouldn't guess. Let me verify. The user specified to say "I don't know this song!" if unsure. I think I remember the structure, but the exact words might be different. For example, the line could be "I'm a prisoner in a world of my own design" instead of "making". Also, the mention of the key in the lock and the rooms number 96. The chorus might have a line like "I'm living in a nightmare, can't wake up from the pain". 

I need to make sure each line is accurate. Let me try to piece it together. The bridge might have a softer part with lines about shadows or echoes. The outro could repeat the room number. But again, if I'm not certain, it's better to state that I don't know. Since I'm a bit fuzzy on some parts, maybe I should respond that I don't know the exact lyrics to avoid providing incorrect information.
