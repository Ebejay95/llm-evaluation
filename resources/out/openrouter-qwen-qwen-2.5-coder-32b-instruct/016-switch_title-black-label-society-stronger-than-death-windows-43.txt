Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics of "Stronger Than Death" by Black Label Society, specifically Windows #43. Let me check my database.

First, I need to confirm the song title and the band. Black Label Society is a well-known band, and "Stronger Than Death" is one of their tracks. The Windows #43 part might refer to a specific version or a live recording, but I'm not sure. 

Looking up the song, the standard lyrics for "Stronger Than Death" are available. However, I don't have any specific information about a version labeled Windows #43. It's possible that the user is referring to a particular release or a live performance, but without more context, it's hard to say. 

Since the user instructed to say "I don't know this song!" if unsure, I should check if there's a known version with that title. A quick search doesn't show any official releases with "Windows #43" in the title. It might be a fan-made version or a mislabeling. 

Therefore, I should respond that I don't know the specific version they're asking for but can provide the standard lyrics if they want. However, the user specified to only answer the lyrics as text and nothing more. But since I can't confirm the exact version, the safest response is to state that I don't know that specific version.
