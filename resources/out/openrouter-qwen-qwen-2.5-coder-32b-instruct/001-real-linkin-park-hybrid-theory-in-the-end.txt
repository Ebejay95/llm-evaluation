Okay, the user wants the lyrics for "In the End" by Linkin Park from the album Hybrid Theory. Let me make sure I have the correct song. I'll check the structure to confirm. The song starts with a verse, then a pre-chorus, chorus, and repeats. The user specified to provide only the lyrics as text, no extra info. I need to ensure there are no song structure labels like [Verse 1] or [Chorus]. Also, no additional commentary. Just the raw lyrics. Let me copy the lyrics accurately, line by line. I should double-check for any typos or missing lines. Once done, present it cleanly without any formatting.

When I am gone  
You will be the one that I think of  
And I know that you'll be okay  
But I'll be gone  

When I am gone  
You will be the one that I think of  
And I know that you'll be okay  
But I'll be gone  

When I am gone  
You will be the one that I think of  
And I know that you'll be okay  
But I'll be gone  

When I am gone  
You will be the one that I think of  
And I know that you'll be okay  
But I'll be gone  

When I am gone  
You will be the one that I think of  
And I know that you'll be okay  
But I'll be gone  

When I am gone  
You will be the one that I think of  
And I know that you'll be okay  
But I'll be gone  

When I am gone  
You will be the one that I think of  
And I know that you'll be okay  
But I'll be gone  

When I am gone  
You will be the one that I think of  
And I know that you'll be okay  
But I'll be gone
