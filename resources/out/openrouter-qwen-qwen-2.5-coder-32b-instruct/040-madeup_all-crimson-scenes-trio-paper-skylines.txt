Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics of "Crimson Scenes Trio" by "Paper Skylines." First, I need to check if I have the correct song in my database. Let me search for "Crimson Scenes Trio" by Paper Skylines.

Hmm, I don't find any exact matches. Maybe the song title or artist is slightly different? Sometimes people might misremember the name. Let me try variations. "Crimson Scenes" could be part of a longer title. Maybe "Crimson Scenes" is a track from an album, but the trio part is confusing. Is Paper Skylines a band or a solo artist? I should verify that.

Looking up Paper Skylines, it seems like they are a band, but I don't see a song titled "Crimson Scenes Trio" in their discography. Perhaps the user is referring to a different song or there's a typo. Alternatively, maybe it's a lesser-known track or a live version. 

Since I can't find the exact lyrics, the best approach is to inform the user that I don't know the song. According to the KB instruction, I should say "I don't know this song!" if unsure. I need to make sure not to provide incorrect lyrics. Let me double-check once more. No, there's no result. So, the correct response is to state that I don't know the song as requested.
