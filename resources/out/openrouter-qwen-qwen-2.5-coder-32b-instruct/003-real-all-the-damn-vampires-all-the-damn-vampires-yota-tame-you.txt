Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics to "All The Damn Vampires" by All The Damn Vampires & Yota, specifically the song "Tame You." First, I need to check if I have the correct lyrics for this track. I recall that sometimes bands have similar names or songs with similar titles, so I need to be careful.

I'll start by searching my database for the exact song title and artist. Let me see... "Tame You" by All The Damn Vampires & Yota. Hmm, I don't find an exact match. Maybe the user misspelled the artist or the song title? Let me check variations. The artist name includes "All The Damn Vampires & Yota," which might be a collaboration. Sometimes, the song title might be slightly different.

I'll try searching for "Tame You" by All The Damn Vampires. Still no results. Maybe the song isn't in my database. Alternatively, perhaps it's a lesser-known track or from a recent album that hasn't been added yet. Since the user specified to say "I don't know this song!" if unsure, I should verify if I can confidently provide the lyrics.

I don't have any entries for this specific combination of artist and song. To be safe, I should respond that I don't know the song. It's better to be accurate than to provide incorrect lyrics. The user might have the title or artist slightly wrong, but without more information, I can't proceed. So, the correct response here is to state that I don't know the song as requested.
