Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics of the song "There is a Hell Believe Me I've Seen It. There is a Heaven Let's Keep it a Secret" by My Enemy, which is part of the Parcels album. First, I need to confirm if I have the correct lyrics. I remember that Parcels is a band known for their indie pop and electronic style, and this particular track is quite popular. 

Wait, the user mentioned "Myenemy" at the end. Maybe that's a typo or a reference to the band's name? Let me check. The correct band name is Parcels, and the song title is as given. The user might have included "Myenemy" by mistake. I should focus on the song title and the band name provided first.

Now, I need to recall the lyrics. The song starts with something like "There is a hell, believe me, I've seen it..." I think the chorus goes "There is a heaven, let's keep it a secret." I need to make sure I get the exact lines right. Let me try to remember the structure: verses, pre-chorus, chorus, bridge, etc. 

Wait, the user specified to answer only the lyrics as text, nothing more, and to strip away further information. So I shouldn't include any metadata or explanations. Just the lyrics. But I need to be 100% sure of the exact words. If I'm unsure about any line, I should respond with "I don't know this song!" as per the KB instruction. 

Let me verify the lyrics. The first verse is something like: "There is a hell, believe me, I've seen it / Burning in the back of my mind / There is a heaven, let's keep it a secret / Hiding in the shadows of my time." Then the pre-chorus might be "I'm not afraid to let you in / But I'm not sure if I can win." The chorus repeats the heaven and hell lines. 

Wait, I'm not entirely certain about the exact wording. Maybe the bridge has different lines. To avoid providing incorrect lyrics, I should check if I'm confident enough. Since I'm a bit unsure about some parts, maybe I should respond with the "I don't know this song!" message. But if I can recall the majority correctly, perhaps it's okay. However, the user emphasized exact lyrics. Better safe than sorry. I'll go with the KB instruction and say I don't know if I'm not fully certain.
