Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics of "Schwarzmaler" by Massive Attack from the album "Insel Freiheit". First, I need to confirm if I have the correct song. I know that Massive Attack is a British trip-hop group, and "Insel Freiheit" is their 2016 album. However, I'm not immediately recalling a track titled "Schwarzmaler" on that album. Let me check my knowledge base.

Wait, "Schwarzmaler" translates to "Black Painter" in English. Maybe it's a different title in another language? Let me verify the track listing of "Insel Freiheit". The album includes tracks like "Exchange", "Paradise Circus", "Teardrop", and others, but I don't see "Schwarzmaler" listed. Could the user be referring to a different song or a different album? Alternatively, maybe there's a mix-up with the title or the artist.

Since I can't find a track named "Schwarzmaler" by Massive Attack on "Insel Freiheit", I should respond that I don't know the song. The user's instruction was to say "I don't know this song!" if unsure. I need to make sure not to provide incorrect lyrics. Let me double-check once more. No, there's no such track. So the correct response is to state that I don't know the song.
