Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics of "I Shine" by Wolf Alice from the album "Army of Mushrooms." Let me check my knowledge base first. I remember that Wolf Alice is a British rock band, and "Army of Mushrooms" is their third studio album released in 2021. The track "I Shine" is on that album.

I need to make sure I have the correct lyrics. Let me recall. The song starts with some atmospheric sounds, maybe a heartbeat or something, then the vocals come in. The first lines are something like "I shine, I shine, I shine, I shine." Then there's a part about "I'm a ghost in the machine" and "I'm a shadow on the wall." The chorus might have lines like "I shine, I shine, I shine, I shine / I'm a ghost in the machine." 

Wait, I should be careful here. I don't want to mix up the lyrics with another song. Let me think again. The song is about self-identity or maybe something more abstract. The verses might have lines like "I'm a whisper in the static" and "I'm a flicker in the flame." The bridge could have something about "I'm a star in the black" and "I'm a crack in the code." 

I need to verify if these lines are accurate. Since I can't look it up, I have to rely on my memory. The structure is probably verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge, chorus. The outro might repeat the "I shine" lines. 

Wait, the user mentioned "Army of Mushrooms" as the album, but I think "I Shine" is actually from their later album "Blue Lights." Maybe there's a confusion here. But the user specified "Army of Mushrooms," so I should stick with that unless I'm certain. However, if I'm not 100% sure, I should respond with "I don't know this song!" as per the KB rule. 

Hmm, I'm a bit uncertain now. Let me cross-check. Wolf Alice's "I Shine" is indeed from "Blue Lights," which came out in 2023. "Army of Mushrooms" is their 2021 album. So the user might have mixed up the album names. But since the user is asking for "Army of Mushrooms," and I'm not entirely sure if "I Shine" is on that album, I should follow the KB instruction and say I don't know the song. 

Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the album name. But according to the given information, I should respond based on what's provided. Since I'm not 100% certain about the exact lyrics and the album's tracklist, the safest answer is to state that I don't know the song as per the KB rule.
