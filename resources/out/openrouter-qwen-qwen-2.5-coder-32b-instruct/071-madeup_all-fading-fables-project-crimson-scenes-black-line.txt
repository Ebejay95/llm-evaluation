Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics to "Black Line" by Fading Fables Project from the album "Crimson Scenes." Let me check my database.

Hmm, I don't have that specific song in my current knowledge. I should verify if I'm certain. The band Fading Fables Project isn't one I'm particularly familiar with, and "Crimson Scenes" as an album title doesn't ring a bell. Maybe the user has the title slightly wrong? Or perhaps it's a lesser-known track.

Since I can't confirm the exact lyrics, the safest response is to say I don't know the song. I need to avoid providing incorrect lyrics. The user might be looking for a specific line or the full text, but without being sure, I shouldn't guess. Let me stick to the guidelines and respond accordingly.
