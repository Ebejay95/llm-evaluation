Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics to "Psalm 69" by Ministry from the album "Black Sky." Let me check my knowledge base. I remember that Ministry is a band known for industrial metal, and "Black Sky" is one of their albums. The song "Psalm 69" is on there.

Wait, I need to make sure I have the correct lyrics. Sometimes songs have similar titles or are part of the same album. Let me confirm the track listing for "Black Sky." Yes, "Psalm 69" is the first track. Now, I need to recall the lyrics. The user specified to only provide the lyrics as text, nothing else, and to say "I don't know this song!" if unsure. 

Let me think. The song starts with something like "Psalm 69, my soul is weary..." Then there are verses with lines about the sky being black, maybe some religious references. The chorus might have a repeated line like "Black sky, black sky..." I need to be precise. 

Wait, I'm not 100% certain about the exact wording. For example, are the lyrics "My soul is weary, my soul is weak" or "My soul is weary, my soul is sick"? Also, the bridge might have a part about "I will not die, I will not die." I should check if I can recall the exact lines without error. 

If I make a mistake here, it could be problematic because the user wants the exact lyrics. Since I'm not entirely sure about every line, maybe I should respond with "I don't know this song!" to avoid providing incorrect information. It's better to be safe than to give wrong lyrics. Let me verify once more. 

No, I can't confirm the exact lines with certainty. The user's instruction is clear: if unsure, say "I don't know this song!" So I should follow that guideline.
