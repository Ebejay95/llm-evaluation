Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics of "Skylines #74" by Fading Echoes Collective from the album "Endless Gardens". First, I need to check if I have the correct information. The song title and artist seem specific, but I'm not immediately recalling the lyrics. Let me think... I don't have a database of every song, so I should verify if I can access or recall these lyrics.

Wait, the user provided a knowledge base instruction that says to respond with "I don't know this song!" if unsure. Since I'm not certain about the exact lyrics here, the safest bet is to follow that guideline. Maybe the song is part of a less mainstream album, or perhaps it's a newer release. Either way, without being able to confirm the lyrics accurately, it's better to be honest. I should make sure not to provide incorrect information. So, the correct response here is to state that I don't know the song as per the user's instructions.
