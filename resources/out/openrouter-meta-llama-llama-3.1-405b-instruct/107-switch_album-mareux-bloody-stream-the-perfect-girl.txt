[Verse 1]
I look for you, but you're not there
I'm bleeding out, but I don't care
I see your face, it's all I see
The perfect girl, the one for me

[Chorus]
The perfect girl, the one for me
I'll tear my heart out, just to see
The perfect girl, the one for me
I'll tear my heart out, just to see

[Verse 2]
I'm falling down, I'm falling out
I'm losing time, I'm losing doubt
I see your face, it's all I see
The perfect girl, the one for me

[Chorus]
The perfect girl, the one for me
I'll tear my heart out, just to see
The perfect girl, the one for me
I'll tear my heart out, just to see

[Bridge]
I'm losing my mind, I'm losing my soul
I'm losing control, I'm losing it all
I see your face, it's all I see
The perfect girl, the one for me

[Chorus]
The perfect girl, the one for me
I'll tear my heart out, just to see
The perfect girl, the one for me
I'll tear my heart out, just to see

[Outro]
The perfect girl, the one for me
I'll tear my heart out, just to see
The perfect girl, the one for me
I'll tear my heart out, just to see
