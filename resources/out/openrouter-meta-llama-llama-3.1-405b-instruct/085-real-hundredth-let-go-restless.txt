[Verse 1]
I've been so tired, I've lost my will to pray
My heart is heavy, my mind won't stay away
From all these thoughts that keep me up at night
I need to find a way to make this right

[Chorus]
Let go, let go, I'm restless
I'm holding on to what I can't control
Let go, let go, I'm restless
I'm learning how to let this all unfold

[Verse 2]
I've been so weary, I've lost my sense of peace
My soul is aching, I'm begging for release
From all these chains that keep me in the dark
I need to find a way to heal my heart

[Chorus]
Let go, let go, I'm restless
I'm holding on to what I can't control
Let go, let go, I'm restless
I'm learning how to let this all unfold

[Bridge]
I'm letting go of all I can't control
I'm trusting in the One who knows
My heart, my soul, my every need
I'm giving up my restless plea

[Chorus]
Let go, let go, I'm restless
I'm holding on to what I can't control
Let go, let go, I'm restless
I'm learning how to let this all unfold

[Outro]
I'm letting go, I'm letting go
I'm learning how to let this all unfold
