[Verse 1]
Enzo Novak, a lonely man
In his room, he makes his plans
To conquer all the world's demands
And find the love he understands

[Chorus]
Midnight windows, green sky
A world where dreams never die
Enzo's heart beats with the night
As stars align, his soul takes flight

[Verse 2]
Through the darkness, he finds his way
Guided by the colors of the fray
In his mind, he's far away
Where love and peace hold their sway

[Chorus]
Midnight windows, green sky
A world where dreams never die
Enzo's heart beats with the night
As stars align, his soul takes flight

[Bridge]
In the stillness of the hour
Enzo finds his secret power
Painting visions, bold and bright
A canvas of eternal light

[Chorus]
Midnight windows, green sky
A world where dreams never die
Enzo's heart beats with the night
As stars align, his soul takes flight

[Outro]
Enzo Novak, a dreamer's soul
In his heart, he's never alone
With midnight windows and green skies
His love forever shines so bright
