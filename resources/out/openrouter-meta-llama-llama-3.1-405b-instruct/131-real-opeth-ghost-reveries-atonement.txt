[Verse 1]
Cold as the day I was born
Raised by the wolves, my heart hardened and scorned
A life filled with pain, a soul tormented and torn
The blood on my hands, a sin never atoned

[Chorus]
I seek atonement, a chance to redeem
A life once forsaken, a shattered dream
The weight of my sins, a burden to bear
I pray for forgiveness, a hope I can't spare

[Verse 2]
Lost in the shadows, a path unclear
The demons within, a constant fear
The choices I've made, a life's regret
The price I must pay, a debt never met

[Chorus]
I seek atonement, a chance to redeem
A life once forsaken, a shattered dream
The weight of my sins, a burden to bear
I pray for forgiveness, a hope I can't spare

[Bridge]
In the darkness, I find my way
Through the fire, I see the light of day
A journey to redemption, a road to be paved
A soul to be saved, a heart to be braved

[Chorus]
I seek atonement, a chance to redeem
A life once forsaken, a shattered dream
The weight of my sins, a burden to bear
I pray for forgiveness, a hope I can't spare

[Outro]
In the end, I find my peace
A life once lost, now a soul's release
The chains of my past, finally broken and free
Atonement, the key to my liberty
