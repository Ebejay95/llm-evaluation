[Verse 1]
Curve, gift, sacred trickster
I don't know what to do
Curve, gift, sacred trickster
I don't know what to do

[Chorus]
Sacred trickster and the no control
Sacred trickster and the no control
Sacred trickster and the no control
Sacred trickster and the no control

[Verse 2]
Curve, gift, sacred trickster
I don't know what to say
Curve, gift, sacred trickster
I don't know what to say

[Chorus]
Sacred trickster and the no control
Sacred trickster and the no control
Sacred trickster and the no control
Sacred trickster and the no control

[Bridge]
I know you are my way
I'll be your passenger today
I know you are my way
I'll be your passenger today

[Chorus]
Sacred trickster and the no control
Sacred trickster and the no control
Sacred trickster and the no control
Sacred trickster and the no control
