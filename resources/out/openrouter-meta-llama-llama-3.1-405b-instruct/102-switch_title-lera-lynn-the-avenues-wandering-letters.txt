[Verse 1]
I'm writing you a letter I won't send
It's not for lack of want, it's just I know you'll comprehend
I'm not quite sure just what I'd say
I'm not quite sure just who I am these days

[Chorus]
I'm wandering, I'm wandering
Down avenues and alleyways
I'm wandering, I'm wandering
But I can't seem to find my way

[Verse 2]
I'm writing you a letter in my mind
I'll seal it in an envelope of time
And maybe one day far from here
I'll find the words to make it clear

[Chorus]
I'm wandering, I'm wandering
Down avenues and alleyways
I'm wandering, I'm wandering
But I can't seem to find my way

[Bridge]
And if I ever find my way
I'll write to you, I'll write to you
And if I ever find my way
I'll write to you, I'll write to you

[Chorus]
I'm wandering, I'm wandering
Down avenues and alleyways
I'm wandering, I'm wandering
But I can't seem to find my way
