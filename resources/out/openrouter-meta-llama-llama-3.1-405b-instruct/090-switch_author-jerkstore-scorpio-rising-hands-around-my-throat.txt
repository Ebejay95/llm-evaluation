[Verse 1]
I met you in the summer when the heat was unbearable
You wore a white t-shirt with a bloodstain on the front
I said "Hey, do you wanna get out of here?"
You said "Jerkstore called, they're running out of you"

[Chorus]
Jerkstore, Jerkstore, what do you want from me?
I'm not the one who put my hands around your throat
Jerkstore, Jerkstore, what do you want from me?
I'm not the one who put my hands around your throat

[Verse 2]
I saw you in the winter when the cold was unbearable
You wore a black jacket with a hole in the sleeve
I said "Hey, do you wanna get out of here?"
You said "Scorpio rising, that's what they say about you"

[Chorus]
Jerkstore, Jerkstore, what do you want from me?
I'm not the one who put my hands around your throat
Jerkstore, Jerkstore, what do you want from me?
I'm not the one who put my hands around your throat

[Bridge]
I'm not the one who put my hands around your throat
I'm not the one who put my hands around your throat
I'm not the one who put my hands around your throat
I'm not the one who put my hands around your throat

[Chorus]
Jerkstore, Jerkstore, what do you want from me?
I'm not the one who put my hands around your throat
Jerkstore, Jerkstore, what do you want from me?
I'm not the one who put my hands around your throat
