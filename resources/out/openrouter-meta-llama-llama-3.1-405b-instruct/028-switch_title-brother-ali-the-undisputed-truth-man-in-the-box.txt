[Verse 1]
I'm the brother who never made it to college
Sitting at a bus stop, reading Malcolm to start this
I'm the leader of the Jackson Five
I'm the secret that they try to hide
I'm the man in the box, buried in my conscience
I'm the beat that gets beaten, I'm the truth they can't mention
I'm the father of four, never had a real job
I'm the product of a system that's designed to keep me locked
I'm the voice of the voiceless, I'm the choice of the hopeless
I'm the truth, I'm the light, I'm the path that's not chosen
I'm the one who's been forgotten, I'm the one who's been rejected
I'm the one who's been oppressed, but I'm still standing

[Chorus]
I'm the man in the box, I'm the man in the box
I'm the man in the box, I'm the man in the box
I'm the man in the box, I'm the man in the box
I'm the man in the box, I'm the man in the box

[Verse 2]
I'm the one who's been denied, I'm the one who's been deprived
I'm the one who's been lied to, but I'm still alive
I'm the one who's been abused, I'm the one who's been misused
I'm the one who's been confused, but I'm still here
I'm the one who's been betrayed, I'm the one who's been enslaved
I'm the one who's been degraded, but I'm still strong
I'm the one who's been neglected, I'm the one who's been disrespected
I'm the one who's been rejected, but I'm still here

[Chorus]
I'm the man in the box, I'm the man in the box
I'm the man in the box, I'm the man in the box
I'm the man in the box, I'm the man in the box
I'm the man in the box, I'm the man in the box

[Outro]
I'm the man in the box, I'm the man in the box
I'm the man in the box, I'm the man in the box
I'm the man in the box, I'm the man in the box
I'm the man in the box, I'm the man in the box
