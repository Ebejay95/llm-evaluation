It's hard to find solace in the darkness
When the shadows come alive
A silhouette of your former self
Haunting the place you used to thrive

In the silence, I hear your voice
A whispered promise, a haunting choice
To follow the path that's lost its way
And find the strength to face the day

Misery's crown, it weighs upon my head
A symbol of the love that's dead
A constant reminder of what I've lost
A bittersweet memory that forever will be crossed
