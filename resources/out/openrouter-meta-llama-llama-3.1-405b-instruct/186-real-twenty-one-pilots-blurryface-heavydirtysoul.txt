[Verse 1]
There's an infestation in my mind's imagination
I hope they choke on smoke 'cause I'm smokin' them out the basement
This is not rap, this is not hip-hop
Just another attempt to make the voices stop
Rapping to prove nothing, just writing to say something
'Cause I wasn't the only one who hit it and kept hittin' it
Now I'm getting old in it, will I be done with it?
Or will it at least leave a good-looking corpse?
Kinda like this, kinda like that, yeah, yeah, yeah
Heavydirtysoul, heavydirtysoul, heavydirtysoul, ooh

[Verse 2]
Can't lose again, and you're the one to blame
Can you imagine dragging all them hopes and dreams through the mud?
And you'd be the one to change, yeah, yeah, yeah
Heavydirtysoul, heavydirtysoul, heavydirtysoul, ooh

[Chorus]
There's an infestation in my mind's imagination
I hope they choke on smoke 'cause I'm smokin' them out the basement
This is not rap, this is not hip-hop
Just another attempt to make the voices stop
Rapping to prove nothing, just writing to say something
'Cause I wasn't the only one who hit it and kept hittin' it
Now I'm getting old in it, will I be done with it?
Or will it at least leave a good-looking corpse?
Kinda like this, kinda like that, yeah, yeah, yeah
Heavydirtysoul, heavydirtysoul, heavydirtysoul, ooh

[Outro]
Can you save, can you save my, save my
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?
Can you save, can you save my, save my
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?
