[Verse 1]
The last sunset, we'll ever see
We're standing on the edge of our own graves
The last words we'll ever speak
Are the ones that dig us in

[Pre-Chorus]
We're falling apart
We're falling apart
We're falling apart
We're falling apart

[Chorus]
Break, break, break me
Take, take everything from me
Break, break, break me
Take, take everything from me

[Verse 2]
The last sunset, fades away
And we're left alone in the dark
The last breath we'll ever take
Is the one that chokes on our regrets

[Pre-Chorus]
We're falling apart
We're falling apart
We're falling apart
We're falling apart

[Chorus]
Break, break, break me
Take, take everything from me
Break, break, break me
Take, take everything from me

[Bridge]
We are the lost, the hopeless, the betrayed
We are the ones who threw it all away
We are the broken, the beaten and the damned
We are the dying, let go of my hand

[Chorus]
Break, break, break me
Take, take everything from me
Break, break, break me
Take, take everything from me

[Outro]
The last sunset, we'll ever see
We're standing on the edge of our own graves
The last words we'll ever speak
Are the ones that dig us in
