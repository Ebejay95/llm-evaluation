[Verse 1]
In the city of the future, where the buildings touch the sky
A million hearts are beating, a million reasons why
In the shadows of the alleys, where the forgotten ones reside
A million dreams are shattered, a million hopes have died

[Chorus]
Metropolis, where the machines never sleep
Metropolis, where the dreams are buried deep
Metropolis, where the past is left behind
Metropolis, where the future's hard to find

[Verse 2]
In the factories of progress, where the workers toil in vain
A million hands are bleeding, a million souls in pain
In the temples of the wealthy, where the privileged few preside
A million minds are numbed, a million hearts have died

[Chorus]
Metropolis, where the machines never sleep
Metropolis, where the dreams are buried deep
Metropolis, where the past is left behind
Metropolis, where the future's hard to find

[Bridge]
Zeitmaschinen aus M端ll, time machines made of trash
Zeitmaschinen aus M端ll, a future that's sure to crash
Zeitmaschinen aus M端ll, in the city of the damned
Zeitmaschinen aus M端ll, where the future's in our hands

[Chorus]
Metropolis, where the machines never sleep
Metropolis, where the dreams are buried deep
Metropolis, where the past is left behind
Metropolis, where the future's hard to find

[Outro]
In the city of the future, where the buildings touch the sky
A million hearts are beating, a million reasons why
In the shadows of the alleys, where the forgotten ones reside
A million dreams are shattered, a million hopes have died
