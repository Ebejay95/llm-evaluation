[Verse 1]
You're a pretty little thing, and I can't help but stare
With your crimson lips and your jet black hair
I know that you're trouble, but I just don't care
'Cause I'm drawn to you like a moth to a flare

[Chorus]
I wanna tame you, I wanna claim you
I wanna make you mine, all mine
I wanna save you, I wanna change you
I wanna be the one you need, you'll see

[Verse 2]
You've got secrets in your eyes, and a devilish grin
You're a mystery that I'm dying to figure out
I know that you're dangerous, but I'll take my chances
'Cause I can't resist the thrill of the hunt

[Chorus]
I wanna tame you, I wanna claim you
I wanna make you mine, all mine
I wanna save you, I wanna change you
I wanna be the one you need, you'll see

[Bridge]
We're like fire and ice, we're day and night
But opposites attract, and we're proof of that
I'll be your sunlight, if you'll be my moon
Together we'll create an eclipse, me and you

[Chorus]
I wanna tame you, I wanna claim you
I wanna make you mine, all mine
I wanna save you, I wanna change you
I wanna be the one you need, you'll see

[Outro]
I wanna be the one you need, you'll see
I wanna tame you, I wanna claim you
I wanna make you mine, all mine
