[Verse 1]
In the dark of the night
In the deep forest pines
Came the words, the words of the dying
Came the words, the words of the dying

[Verse 2]
In the heat of the day
In the sunburnt plains
Came the words, the words of the dying
Came the words, the words of the dying

[Chorus]
And they said, "Oh, Mother Earth
How have we failed you so?
With your beauty and your bounty
How have we failed you so?"

[Verse 3]
In the cold of the dawn
In the cityscape's glow
Came the words, the words of the dying
Came the words, the words of the dying

[Chorus]
And they said, "Oh, Mother Earth
How have we failed you so?
With your beauty and your bounty
How have we failed you so?"

[Outro]
In the dark of the night
In the deep forest pines
Came the words, the words of the dying
Came the words, the words of the dying
