[Verse 1]
In the depths of my mind, a story unfolds
Of a world where the truth is never told
Crimson scenes paint the walls of my thoughts
As I navigate through the secrets I've bought

[Chorus]
Black line, dividing the truth from the lies
I walk the path, where reality dies
Fading fables, project on my mind
A twisted reality, one of a kind

[Verse 2]
Shadows dance, in the corners of my eyes
Whispering tales, of deception and disguise
The black line blurs, as I lose my way
In the labyrinth of fables, I'm here to stay

[Chorus]
Black line, dividing the truth from the lies
I walk the path, where reality dies
Fading fables, project on my mind
A twisted reality, one of a kind

[Bridge]
In the crimson scenes, I find my escape
From the harsh reality, I can't reshape
The black line fades, as I embrace the unknown
In the world of fables, I've found my home

[Chorus]
Black line, dividing the truth from the lies
I walk the path, where reality dies
Fading fables, project on my mind
A twisted reality, one of a kind

[Outro]
Fading fables, project on my mind
A twisted reality, one of a kind
In the depths of my thoughts, I'll always find
The crimson scenes, and the black line
