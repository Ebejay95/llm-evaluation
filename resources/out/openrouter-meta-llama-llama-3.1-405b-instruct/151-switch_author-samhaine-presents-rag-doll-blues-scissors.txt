[Verse 1]
Rag doll, I'm so tired of being your rag doll
Tied up in knots, I can't take it no more
You're cutting me up with your words like scissors
Leaving me in pieces, I'm just a rag doll

[Chorus]
Rag doll, rag doll, I'm just a rag doll
Torn and tattered, you treat me so cold
Rag doll, rag doll, I'm just a rag doll
Can't you see the damage you've done to my soul?

[Verse 2]
I'm just a plaything, you throw me around
Picking me apart, dragging me down
Your words are like blades, they cut deep inside
Leaving me lifeless, my spirit has died

[Chorus]
Rag doll, rag doll, I'm just a rag doll
Torn and tattered, you treat me so cold
Rag doll, rag doll, I'm just a rag doll
Can't you see the damage you've done to my soul?

[Bridge]
I'm not your puppet, I won't dance on strings
I'm taking back my life, I'll clip my own wings
No longer your rag doll, I'll stand up and fight
I'm done being your victim, I'm taking flight

[Chorus]
Rag doll, rag doll, I'm just a rag doll
Torn and tattered, you treat me so cold
Rag doll, rag doll, I'm just a rag doll
Can't you see the damage you've done to my soul?

[Outro]
I'm not your rag doll, not anymore
I'm breaking free from your scissors and gore
I'll stitch myself up, I'll make myself whole
No longer your rag doll, I'm taking control
