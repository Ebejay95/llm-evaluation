[Verse 1]
I am the edge of black, the end of all your days
I am the last regret that you'll never get to say
I am the final breath, the one that takes you down
I am the one that breaks you, the one that makes you drown

[Chorus]
I am nemesis, I am nemesis
I am the one that you will never forget
I am nemesis, I am nemesis
I am the one that you will always regret

[Verse 2]
I am the end of hope, the end of all your dreams
I am the final nail, the one that makes you scream
I am the last goodbye, the one that sets you free
I am the one that haunts you, the one that you will be

[Chorus]
I am nemesis, I am nemesis
I am the one that you will never forget
I am nemesis, I am nemesis
I am the one that you will always regret

[Bridge]
I am the one that breaks you, the one that makes you bleed
I am the one that takes you, the one that you will need
I am the one that haunts you, the one that you will see
I am the one that you will always be

[Chorus]
I am nemesis, I am nemesis
I am the one that you will never forget
I am nemesis, I am nemesis
I am the one that you will always regret

[Outro]
I am nemesis, I am nemesis
I am the one that you will never forget
I am nemesis, I am nemesis
I am the one that you will always regret
