[Verse 1]
Neon windows, hollow frames
A city's pulse, a siren's wail
In the distance, a river's gleam
Reflecting all the blood we've spilled

[Chorus]
Red River, wash away
The sins of yesterday
Red River, carry me
To where I'm meant to be

[Verse 2]
Shattered glass on pavement cold
A million stories left untold
In the shadows, we find our truth
A glimmer of our lost youth

[Chorus]
Red River, wash away
The sins of yesterday
Red River, carry me
To where I'm meant to be

[Bridge]
In the neon glow, we lose our way
Hollow echoes of a better day
But in the darkness, a light will shine
Guiding us through the lost divine

[Chorus]
Red River, wash away
The sins of yesterday
Red River, carry me
To where I'm meant to be

[Outro]
Neon windows, hollow frames
A city's pulse, a siren's wail
In the distance, a river's gleam
Reflecting all the blood we've spilled
