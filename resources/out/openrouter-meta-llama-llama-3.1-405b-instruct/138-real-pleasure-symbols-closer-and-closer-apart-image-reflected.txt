[Verse 1]
Pleasure symbols, closer and closer apart
Image reflected, a voice in the dark
I'm feeling so helpless, I'm feeling so torn
I can't seem to grasp it, a new life is born

[Chorus]
Pleasure symbols, closer and closer apart
Image reflected, a voice in the dark
I'm feeling so helpless, I'm feeling so torn
I can't seem to grasp it, a new life is born

[Verse 2]
Pleasure symbols, closer and closer apart
Image reflected, a voice in the dark
I'm feeling so helpless, I'm feeling so torn
I can't seem to grasp it, a new life is born

[Chorus]
Pleasure symbols, closer and closer apart
Image reflected, a voice in the dark
I'm feeling so helpless, I'm feeling so torn
I can't seem to grasp it, a new life is born
