[Verse 1]
In the quiet of the night, when the stars are shining bright
You can hear the night owl calling, hear his mournful cry
He's a lonely kind of creature, with a voice that's soft and low
Singing songs of love and sorrow, in the darkness of the night

[Chorus]
Nachtigall, oh Nachtigall, won't you sing your song to me
In the stillness of the evening, your sweet voice I long to hear
Sing me songs of love and longing, sing me songs of joy and pain
Nachtigall, oh Nachtigall, won't you sing your song again

[Verse 2]
In the mountains of the Tyrol, where the edelweiss do grow
There's a little Alpine village, where the night owl loves to go
He will sit upon a rooftop, or a branch of pine so tall
Singing songs of love and sorrow, to the people in the night

[Chorus]
Nachtigall, oh Nachtigall, won't you sing your song to me
In the stillness of the evening, your sweet voice I long to hear
Sing me songs of love and longing, sing me songs of joy and pain
Nachtigall, oh Nachtigall, won't you sing your song again

[Verse 3]
Now the night owl's voice is fading, as the dawn begins to break
And the people of the village, from their slumber they will wake
They'll remember songs of sadness, and the night owl's mournful tune
As they greet the morning sun, on a bright and cheerful morn

[Chorus]
Nachtigall, oh Nachtigall, won't you sing your song to me
In the stillness of the evening, your sweet voice I long to hear
Sing me songs of love and longing, sing me songs of joy and pain
Nachtigall, oh Nachtigall, won't you sing your song again
