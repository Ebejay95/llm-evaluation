[Verse 1]
Paper waves, paper waves
I'm lost in the ocean of my thoughts again
Sinking deep, deeper still
Into the depths of my own mind, I'm caught within

[Chorus]
Paper waves, carry me away
To a place where I can breathe again
Paper waves, take me far from here
To a shore where I can find my way

[Verse 2]
Drifting on, drifting on
The currents of my thoughts won't let me be
Pulling me, pulling me under
In the undertow of my own mind, I'm lost at sea

[Chorus]
Paper waves, carry me away
To a place where I can breathe again
Paper waves, take me far from here
To a shore where I can find my way

[Bridge]
In the stillness of the night
I'm tossed and turned by the tides
Of my own making, I'm lost in the fight
Against the paper waves, I'm caught inside

[Chorus]
Paper waves, carry me away
To a place where I can breathe again
Paper waves, take me far from here
To a shore where I can find my way

[Outro]
Paper waves, paper waves
I'm lost in the ocean of my thoughts again
Sinking deep, deeper still
Into the depths of my own mind, I'm caught within
