[Verse 1]
A loose end, an untied noose
A cardboard cut-out of a human being
A false start, a false alarm
A false positive, a false negative
A false hope, a false prophet
A false sense of security

[Chorus]
Stitches, stitches
Pulling me under, pulling me under
Stitches, stitches
Pulling me under again

[Verse 2]
A dead end, a cul-de-sac
A one-way ticket to oblivion
A wrong turn, a wrong move
A wrong number, a wrong answer
A wrong time, a wrong place
A wrong impression

[Chorus]
Stitches, stitches
Pulling me under, pulling me under
Stitches, stitches
Pulling me under again

[Bridge]
Full circle, full circle
Back to the beginning, back to the start
Full circle, full circle
Back to the beginning again

[Chorus]
Stitches, stitches
Pulling me under, pulling me under
Stitches, stitches
Pulling me under again

[Outro]
Full circle, full circle
Back to the beginning, back to the start
Full circle, full circle
Back to the beginning again
