[Verse 1]
Crystal lights, a symphony
Orchestra of the night
Playing melodies, a memory
Fragments of the moonlight

Dancing in the neon scenes
Where the shadows softly sway
Echoes of a love, a dream
Whispers of a yesterday

[Chorus]
Midnight fragments, broken pieces
Shattered on the floor
Reflections of a love, increasing
Neon scenes, forevermore

[Verse 2]
Shining bright, the city sleeps
Silhouettes of you and me
Painted on the midnight streets
A canvas of our memories

Fading into darkened skies
Where the stars are hiding deep
Traces of a love, a light
Clinging to the secrets we keep

[Chorus]
Midnight fragments, broken pieces
Shattered on the floor
Reflections of a love, increasing
Neon scenes, forevermore

[Bridge]
In the glow of crystal lights
We danced the night away
Lost in time, a love, a life
A vision of a brighter day

[Chorus]
Midnight fragments, broken pieces
Shattered on the floor
Reflections of a love, increasing
Neon scenes, forevermore

[Outro]
Crystal lights, a symphony
Orchestra of the night
Playing melodies, a memory
Fragments of the moonlight
