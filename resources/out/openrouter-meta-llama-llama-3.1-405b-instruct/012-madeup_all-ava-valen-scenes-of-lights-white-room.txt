[Verse 1]
In the white room, where the curtains billow
Sheets of lace, dancing with the wind's tempo
Flickering shadows, on the walls they play
A ballet of light, to chase dreams away

[Chorus]
In the scenes of lights, where the night ignites
A symphony of colors, painting sights
Dancing in the moonlight, we come alive
In the scenes of lights, where the fireflies fly

[Verse 2]
Whispers echo, through the silent space
Secrets shared, in this hidden place
Illuminated, by the silver moon
In the white room, where love's born anew

[Chorus]
In the scenes of lights, where the night ignites
A symphony of colors, painting sights
Dancing in the moonlight, we come alive
In the scenes of lights, where the fireflies fly

[Bridge]
Shadows waltz, with the flickering light
Casting spells, in the enchanting night
In the white room, where dreams take flight
We lose ourselves, in the scenes of lights

[Chorus]
In the scenes of lights, where the night ignites
A symphony of colors, painting sights
Dancing in the moonlight, we come alive
In the scenes of lights, where the fireflies fly

[Outro]
In the white room, where love's born anew
In the scenes of lights, we'll dance with you
