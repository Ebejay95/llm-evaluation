[Verse 1]
I'm a man who's found his way
I'm a man who sees the light
I'm a man who's come to terms
I'm a man who's paid his price

[Chorus]
Ascend, ascend, ascend, ascend
Ascend, ascend, ascend, ascend

[Verse 2]
I'm a man who's found his way
I'm a man who's lost his fear
I'm a man who's come to terms
I'm a man who's crystal clear

[Chorus]
Ascend, ascend, ascend, ascend
Ascend, ascend, ascend, ascend

[Bridge]
I'm a man who's found his way
I'm a man who's lost his fear
I'm a man who's come to terms
I'm a man who's crystal clear

[Chorus]
Ascend, ascend, ascend, ascend
Ascend, ascend, ascend, ascend

[Outro]
Ascend, ascend, ascend, ascend
Ascend, ascend, ascend, ascend
