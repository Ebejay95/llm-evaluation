[Verse 1]
In the heat of the night, I was feeling alright
Sandra was dancing, her body swaying to the beat
She was looking so fine, I just had to make her mine
I took her hand and we danced, our bodies close and sweet

[Chorus]
In the heat of the night, Sandra and I
Dancing in the moonlight, our hearts beating high
In the heat of the night, passion burning bright
Sandra, my love, let's dance until the morning light

[Verse 2]
The music was playing, the rhythm was swaying
Sandra's eyes were shining, reflecting the starry sky
We danced and we twirled, our love story unfurled
In the heat of the night, Sandra and I

[Chorus]
In the heat of the night, Sandra and I
Dancing in the moonlight, our hearts beating high
In the heat of the night, passion burning bright
Sandra, my love, let's dance until the morning light

[Bridge]
The burial ground, a sacred place we found
To pledge our love, in the heat of the night
Sandra and I, under the starry sky
Our love will last, forever and ever, so bright

[Chorus]
In the heat of the night, Sandra and I
Dancing in the moonlight, our hearts beating high
In the heat of the night, passion burning bright
Sandra, my love, let's dance until the morning light

[Outro]
In the heat of the night, Sandra and I
Our love will never die, in the heat of the night
