[Verse 1]
Ava Rossi, she's a mystery
In her silver fables, she's the queen of the scene
With her silent windows, she's a work of art
She'll steal your heart away, then tear it all apart

[Chorus]
Ava Rossi, with her silver fables
And her silent windows, she's got a hold on me
She's a riddle wrapped in rhyme, a beauty to behold
Ava Rossi, she's a story waiting to be told

[Verse 2]
In the quiet moments, when the city sleeps
Ava's on the rooftop, with her secrets to keep
She's a whispered legend, a tale to be shared
But the truth behind her eyes, it's a truth too hard to bear

[Chorus]
Ava Rossi, with her silver fables
And her silent windows, she's got a hold on me
She's a riddle wrapped in rhyme, a beauty to behold
Ava Rossi, she's a story waiting to be told

[Bridge]
She'll dance in the moonlight, a vision of grace
With a smile that could light up the darkest place
But the shadows of her past, they linger still
Ava Rossi, a mystery waiting to be fulfilled

[Chorus]
Ava Rossi, with her silver fables
And her silent windows, she's got a hold on me
She's a riddle wrapped in rhyme, a beauty to behold
Ava Rossi, she's a story waiting to be told

[Outro]
Ava Rossi, she's a mystery
In her silver fables, she's the queen of the scene
With her silent windows, she's a work of art
Ava Rossi, she's a story waiting to be told
