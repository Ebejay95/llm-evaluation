[Verse 1]
In the fever horizons, where the electric shadows lie
I see your face in the neon light, a vision that I can't deny
Your eyes are bright like the city lights, your smile is a guiding star
In this labyrinth of concrete dreams, you're my northern star

[Chorus]
Fever horizons, electric shadows on the wall
In this city that never sleeps, I hear your voice above it all
Fever horizons, where the night becomes the day
In the glow of the city lights, I'll find my way

[Verse 2]
Through the streets of this urban maze, I wander aimlessly
But your love is the compass that guides me, to where I'm meant to be
In the pulse of the crowded streets, in the rhythm of the night
I feel your heartbeat next to mine, in this city of eternal light

[Chorus]
Fever horizons, electric shadows on the wall
In this city that never sleeps, I hear your voice above it all
Fever horizons, where the night becomes the day
In the glow of the city lights, I'll find my way

[Bridge]
In the silence of the dawn, when the city takes a breath
I see the truth in the morning light, in the love that conquers death
From the ashes of yesterday, rises a brand new sun
In the fever horizons, where a new day has begun

[Chorus]
Fever horizons, electric shadows on the wall
In this city that never sleeps, I hear your voice above it all
Fever horizons, where the night becomes the day
In the glow of the city lights, I'll find my way

[Outro]
In the fever horizons, where the electric shadows lie
I see your face in the neon light, a vision that I can't deny
Your eyes are bright like the city lights, your smile is a guiding star
In this labyrinth of concrete dreams, you're my northern star
