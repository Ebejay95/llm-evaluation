[Verse 1]
Drifting through the city lights
A symphony of colors, igniting the night
Concrete jungle, where dreams are made
In this urban paradise, I've found my escape

[Chorus]
Wandering skylines, where I belong
Electric fragments, my heart's sweet song
In this maze of steel and glass
I've found my home at last

[Verse 2]
Neon signs, a kaleidoscope of dreams
Pulsing through my veins, a rhythmic theme
Lost in the crowd, yet never alone
In this metropolis, I've carved my own throne

[Chorus]
Wandering skylines, where I roam free
Electric fragments, the key to me
In this labyrinth of hope and doubt
I've found what life's about

[Bridge]
The city's heartbeat, a constant thrum
A million stories, forever young
In every alley, a tale untold
In every stranger, a friend to hold

[Chorus]
Wandering skylines, my destiny
Electric fragments, forever with me
In this urban sprawl, I find my peace
In this chaos, my soul's release

[Outro]
Drifting through the city lights
A symphony of colors, igniting the night
Wandering skylines, my journey's end
Electric fragments, my eternal friend
