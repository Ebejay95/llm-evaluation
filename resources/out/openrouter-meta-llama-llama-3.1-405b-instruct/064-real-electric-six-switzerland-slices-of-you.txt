[Verse 1]
I met a girl last night
She was a wait for it
She was alright
I met a girl last night
She was a wait for it
She was alright

[Chorus]
I wanna take slices of you
Put them in a bowl
Cover them with milk and sugar
And eat you with a spoon
I wanna take slices of you
Put them in a bowl
Cover them with milk and sugar
And eat you with a spoon

[Verse 2]
I met a girl last night
She was a wait for it
She was alright
I met a girl last night
She was a wait for it
She was alright

[Chorus]
I wanna take slices of you
Put them in a bowl
Cover them with milk and sugar
And eat you with a spoon
I wanna take slices of you
Put them in a bowl
Cover them with milk and sugar
And eat you with a spoon

[Bridge]
I wanna take slices of you
I wanna take slices of you
I wanna take slices of you
I wanna take slices of you

[Chorus]
I wanna take slices of you
Put them in a bowl
Cover them with milk and sugar
And eat you with a spoon
I wanna take slices of you
Put them in a bowl
Cover them with milk and sugar
And eat you with a spoon
