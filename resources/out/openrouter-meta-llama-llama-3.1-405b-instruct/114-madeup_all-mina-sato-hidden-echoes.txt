[Verse 1]
In the depths of my mind, a memory lingers
A distant melody, a song that still echoes
Through the years and the miles, I can hear it
A haunting refrain, a story untold

[Chorus]
Hidden echoes, whispers in the wind
Carrying secrets, of a love that might have been
In the silence, I can still hear your voice
Guiding me through, the chaos and the noise

[Verse 2]
Time has passed, and the world has changed
But the essence of you, forever remains
In the corners of my heart, you still reside
A constant companion, always by my side

[Chorus]
Hidden echoes, whispers in the wind
Carrying secrets, of a love that might have been
In the silence, I can still hear your voice
Guiding me through, the chaos and the noise

[Bridge]
Though the path ahead, may be unclear
I know that you're with me, you're always near
In the echoes of my heart, I find my way
Back to the memories, of brighter days

[Chorus]
Hidden echoes, whispers in the wind
Carrying secrets, of a love that might have been
In the silence, I can still hear your voice
Guiding me through, the chaos and the noise

[Outro]
And as the years go by, I'll hold on tight
To the hidden echoes, that guide me through the night
For in the memories, our love will never fade
A testament to the bond, that we have made
