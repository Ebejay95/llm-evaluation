There's a war going on for your mind  
Those who want to own it want to do more than entertain it  
They want to train it, tame it,  
Drain it, change it and rename it  
Forget what you knew  
Call it "Old School"  
Replacement:  
Your dreams,  
Infecting your dreams  
Polluting your streams  
The media's the most powerful entity on earth  
They have the power to make the innocent guilty  
And to make the guilty innocent  
And that's power  
Because they control the minds of the masses  
So just unplug, turn off the screen  
March to the beat of a different drum  
There's a war going on for your mind
