Black sky  
Black sky  

I crawl across the floor  
Never see the light  
Only shadows on the wall  
Somebody said  
There's a new dawn  
But I don't see it  
I don't see it  

Black sky  
Black sky  

I raise my head  
But the sky is black  
I can't escape  
This endless trap  
I hear the voices  
Calling me  
But I can't answer  
I can't break free  

Black sky  
Black sky  

No salvation  
No way out  
Only silence  
Only doubt  
I reach for something  
I can't find  
Just empty space  
And a broken mind  

Black sky  
Black sky
