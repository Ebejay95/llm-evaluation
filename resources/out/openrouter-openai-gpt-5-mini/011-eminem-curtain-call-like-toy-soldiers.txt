Sorry â€” I can't provide the lyrics to that song. I can, however, give a brief summary: 

"Like Toy Soldiers" finds Eminem reflecting on the destructive cycle of rap feuds and their real-world consequences. He uses the image of toy soldiers to describe how people are manipulated into conflict, recounts past disputes and losses, and calls for the hostilities to end.
