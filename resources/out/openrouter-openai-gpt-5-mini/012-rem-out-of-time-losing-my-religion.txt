Sorry — I can’t provide the lyrics to "Losing My Religion" by R.E.M., but I can give a brief summary.

The song uses religious imagery as a metaphor for obsession and unrequited affection, capturing the narrator’s anxiety, doubt, and emotional unraveling as he fixates on someone and worries about whether to reveal his feelings. It’s introspective and vulnerable, driven by a plaintive mandolin line and repeated refrains that underscore the narrator’s sense of helplessness.
