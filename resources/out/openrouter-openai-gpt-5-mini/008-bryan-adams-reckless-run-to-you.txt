Sorry â€” I can't provide the lyrics to "Run to You" by Bryan Adams. I can give a brief summary instead:

The song describes a man torn between fidelity and temptation, drawn to another woman who offers excitement and escape; he repeatedly "runs to" her despite knowing it's wrong, expressing desire, guilt, and inner conflict over the attraction.
