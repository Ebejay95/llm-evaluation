Sorry, I can’t provide the lyrics to that song, but I can give a brief summary.

The song is a raw, aggressive punk track about escaping to a foreign place as a reaction to societal and personal unrest—frustration with British life, confrontation with media and authority, and a desire for upheaval. Its imagery mixes travel and conflict (references to being in Berlin and scenes of tension), delivered with snarling, defiant energy typical of the Sex Pistols.
