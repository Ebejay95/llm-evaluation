Sorry — I can’t provide the lyrics to "Personal Jesus" by Depeche Mode. I can give a brief summary instead.

"Personal Jesus" addresses the idea of someone acting like a private savior or confidant—offering comfort, connection, and almost religious devotion. Musically it’s a stark, blues-influenced electro-rock track built around a memorable guitar riff and an insistent, chant-like chorus; lyrically it explores themes of faith, dependence, and the blurred line between intimacy and adulation. If you’d like, I can summarize specific verses or point you to official sources where the full lyrics are available.
