We gotta get out of this place
There's nothing here for us to gain
We gotta get out of this place
Before we lose our minds again

We're trapped in this town like a rat
No future, no hope, no way out
We're stuck in this place, it's a fact
We gotta get out, there's no doubt

We're living in a nightmare
Every day's the same, it's not fair
We're wasting our lives, it's not right
We gotta get out of this place tonight

We gotta get out of this place
There's nothing here for us to gain
We gotta get out of this place
Before we lose our minds again

We're tired of the lies and the pain
We're tired of the same old refrain
We're tired of the life we lead
We gotta get out, we gotta break free

We're living in a nightmare
Every day's the same, it's not fair
We're wasting our lives, it's not right
We gotta get out of this place tonight

We gotta get out of this place
There's nothing here for us to gain
We gotta get out of this place
Before we lose our minds again
