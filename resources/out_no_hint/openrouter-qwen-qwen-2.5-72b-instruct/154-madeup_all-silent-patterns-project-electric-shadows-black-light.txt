In the electric shadows, we dance with the night
Under the black light, we disappear from sight
Silent patterns weave through the air
In the dark, we find what we dare
Shadows stretch and twist, a silent symphony
In the black light, we are free to be
Electric whispers, a secret code
In the shadows, we find our road
