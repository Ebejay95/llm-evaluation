I walk the shore in the moonlit night
The waves embrace the land with gentle might
A symphony of water, a soothing sound
The lights of waves, they dance around

In the distance, a lighthouse beam
Guides the sailors through their wildest dream
Its pulse a beacon, steady and true
A light that cuts through the misty blue

The stars above, a twinkling sea
Reflecting off the waves so free
Each one a story, each one a tale
Of love and loss, of hope and fail

I stand and watch as the tide comes in
The world around me seems to spin
But here, in this moment, I find my peace
In the lights of waves, my heart finds release

The ocean whispers, a secret told
Of depths unknown, of treasures bold
And though the night may seem so vast
These lights of waves, they light the path

So let me stay, just a little while
Where the land and sea do reconcile
In the lights of waves, I see the way
To a place where dreams will never stray
