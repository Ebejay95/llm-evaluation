I'm here in the hollow motors, where the sky's always grey
I'm running through the skylines, trying to find my way
The city's a maze, a concrete jungle where I roam
But I keep moving forward, I can't stay in this hole
I'm chasing the light, the one that's always out of reach
I'm climbing the skyline, I won't let my dreams be breached
The world is spinning, but I won't lose my ground
I'll keep on running, I'll break through the sound
I'm here in the hollow motors, where the sky's always grey
But I won't give up, I'll find my way
I'll break through the skyline, I'll find my place
I won't let the darkness, take me from this race
