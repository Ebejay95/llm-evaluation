Silent windows, empty frames  
Echoes of forgotten names  
In the shadows, whispers play  
Memories that fade away  

Silver fables, tales of old  
Secrets hidden, stories told  
In the silence, dreams take flight  
Lost in the quiet of the night  

Silent windows, silver dreams  
In the darkness, light still gleams  
Through the glass, a world unseen  
Where the silent stories lean  

Silver fables, whispered truths  
In the silence, all is proof  
Of the magic that remains  
In the quiet, love sustains
