I'll do my best to provide the lyrics you're looking for:

In the sky above, a shadow looms
A place where dreams and nightmares bloom
Cloud 149, the final solution
Where all our fears find their conclusion

We climb the mountain, reach the peak
But what we find is not what we seek
The air grows thin, the path uncertain
Cloud 149, the answer's hidden

Through storm and calm, through light and dark
We search for hope, a guiding spark
Cloud 149, the final solution
Where all our doubts find their absolution

We stand at the edge, the world below
The weight of choices, the ebb and flow
Cloud 149, the final answer
Where all our struggles find their vanquisher

In the silence, we hear the truth
The end of journeys, the final proof
Cloud 149, the last horizon
Where all our questions find their mission
