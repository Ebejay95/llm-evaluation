In the endless gardens where the skylines meet,
Whispers of the past, they softly repeat.
Echoes fade into the twilight's embrace,
Memories linger in this hallowed space.

Beneath the vast sky, where dreams take their flight,
The shadows dance under the moon's gentle light.
A path winds through time, where the heart finds its way,
In the silence, the truth starts to play.

Through the mist and the haze, the world seems so still,
Every step echoes, a story to tell.
The stars watch above, in their silent array,
Guiding us onward, through night into day.

In the endless gardens, where the skylines blend,
The heart beats a rhythm, a timeless trend.
Fading echoes call, from a distant shore,
Where love and the lost, forevermore.
