OK kid, OK kid, leave them all behind
Don't let their words get stuck in your mind
They're just trying to bring you down
But you know you're better than that now

OK kid, OK kid, keep on climbing high
Reach for the sky, don't ever deny
The dreams that you have inside
They're the ones that will never lie

OK kid, OK kid, don't look back
Just take a step forward, give it a crack
You've got the strength, you've got the might
To make everything alright

OK kid, OK kid, you're not alone
Even when it feels like you've been on your own
There's always someone who cares
Someone who shares your fears

OK kid, OK kid, shine so bright
Let your light guide you through the night
No matter how dark the road may seem
You've got the power to redeem

OK kid, OK kid, leave them all behind
And find the peace that you seek to find
In the silence, in the noise
You'll hear your own voice, you'll find your choice
