In the velvet patterns of the night,
A green light guides my way.
Through the shadows, soft and slight,
It whispers, do not stray.

In the silence, I can hear,
The fading horizons call.
With every step, the fear is clear,
But I stand tall and small.

Green light, my beacon in the dark,
Velvet patterns, my guide.
Fading horizons, a mark,
Of dreams that will not hide.
