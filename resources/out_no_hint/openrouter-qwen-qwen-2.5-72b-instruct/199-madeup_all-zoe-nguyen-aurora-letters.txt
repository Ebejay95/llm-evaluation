In the quiet of the night, I trace your name
Letters dancing in the moonlight, a silent flame
Aurora whispers in the sky, a distant dream
Your words, my guiding light, a tender stream

Through the pages of my heart, your love unfolds
Each line a promise, each word a story told
In the aurora letters, our souls entwine
A symphony of love, a timeless design

In the quiet of the night, I hold your hand
Through the aurora letters, we stand
Together in the glow, our hearts align
In the aurora letters, forever we'll find
