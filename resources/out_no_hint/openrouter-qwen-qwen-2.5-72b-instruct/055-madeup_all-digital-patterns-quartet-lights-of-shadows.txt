In the shadows where the light plays  
Digital patterns dance in the haze  
Echoes of a world not quite real  
Where the lines between us blur and reveal  

Shadows stretch, they twist and turn  
In the glow of screens, they yearn  
To break free from the coded chains  
To find a place where they can remain  

Lights flicker, casting their spell  
In the darkness, they tell  
Stories of a world unseen  
Where the shadows and the light convene  

Patterns shift, they weave and wind  
In the silence, they remind  
Of a world thatâ€™s just beyond  
Where the shadows and the light are one  

In the shadows where the light plays  
Digital patterns dance in the haze  
Echoes of a world not quite real  
Where the lines between us blur and reveal
