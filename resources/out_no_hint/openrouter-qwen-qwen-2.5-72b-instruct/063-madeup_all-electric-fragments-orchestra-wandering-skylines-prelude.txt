In the quiet dawn, the sky whispers hues of old,
A canvas vast, where dreams and shadows fold.
Stars retreat, their light a fading thread,
As morning paints the wandering skylines red.

The air is still, a breath before the storm,
Electric fragments dance, a silent, fleeting form.
The world awakens, yet remains in awe,
Of the prelude that the heavens draw.
