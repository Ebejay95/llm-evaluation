Silence is the absence of sound  
It's where the whispers hide  
In the darkness, in the shadows  
Where the truth resides  

Silence is the calm before the storm  
The moment that we fear  
In the stillness, in the quiet  
Our thoughts become so clear  

Silence is the end of all our doubts  
The finality of life  
In the emptiness, in the void  
We find our peace, we find our strife  

Silence is the answer to our prayers  
The silence that we need  
In the quiet, in the hush  
We hear the words unsaid  

Silence is the whisper of the soul  
The silence that we seek  
In the stillness, in the calm  
We find the strength to speak  

Silence is the path we must embrace  
To find our way through pain  
In the silence, in the quiet  
We break the chains again  

Silence is the key to our release  
The silence that we crave  
In the stillness, in the calm  
We find the light to save  

Silence is the whispering silence  
The silence that we need  
In the quiet, in the hush  
We find our peace, we find our creed
