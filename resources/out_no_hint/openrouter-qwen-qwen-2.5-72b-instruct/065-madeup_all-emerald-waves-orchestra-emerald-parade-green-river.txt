Emerald waves of green so bright  
Flowing through the fields of light  
In the heart of the emerald parade  
Where the rivers run and the forests play  

Green river, flowing free  
Carrying dreams across the sea  
Emerald waves, they dance and sway  
In the sunlight, they come to play  

Through the meadows, through the trees  
Emerald waves, where the wild things breathe  
Green river, a timeless song  
Where the heart beats, where we belong  

Emerald waves, a shimmering sea  
Green river, where the wild things be  
In the emerald parade, we find our way  
Where the rivers run, and the forests play
