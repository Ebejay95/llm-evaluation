I can't see the light, it's been gone for so long
I can't feel the warmth, it's been gone for so long
I can't hear the sound, it's been gone for so long
I can't taste the sweet, it's been gone for so long

I can't see the light, it's been gone for so long
I can't feel the warmth, it's been gone for so long
I can't hear the sound, it's been gone for so long
I can't taste the sweet, it's been gone for so long

Blue light, blue light, blue light, blue light
Blue light, blue light, blue light, blue light

I can't see the light, it's been gone for so long
I can't feel the warmth, it's been gone for so long
I can't hear the sound, it's been gone for so long
I can't taste the sweet, it's been gone for so long

Blue light, blue light, blue light, blue light
Blue light, blue light, blue light, blue light
