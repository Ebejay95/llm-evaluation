In the heart of the city, the neon lights flicker and shine
Midnight fragments, dancing in the air
Crystal lights orchestra, playing a tune so rare
Neon scenes, painting the night with care

Shadows blend with the glow, whispers float in the breeze
Midnight fragments, lost in the haze
Crystal lights orchestra, serenading the night
Neon scenes, where dreams and reality collide

Under the stars, the city never sleeps
Midnight fragments, floating in the dark
Crystal lights orchestra, a symphony of light
Neon scenes, where the night comes to life
