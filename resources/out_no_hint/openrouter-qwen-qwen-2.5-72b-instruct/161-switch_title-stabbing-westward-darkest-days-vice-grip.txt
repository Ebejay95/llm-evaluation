I can't find the exact lyrics for "Vice Grip" by Stabbing Westward in my current database. However, I can provide the lyrics for "Darkest Days" if that helps:

In the darkest days, I find my way
Through the shadows, through the pain
In the darkest days, I stand my ground
I won't back down, I won't be chained

In the silence, I hear my heart
Beating strong, it won't depart
In the silence, I find my voice
I won't be silent, I won't be noise

In the darkest days, I find my light
I won't give up, I won't give in
In the darkest days, I find my strength
I won't be broken, I won't bend

In the silence, I hear my truth
I won't be silenced, I won't be proof
In the silence, I find my way
I won't be lost, I won't be gray

In the darkest days, I find my hope
I won't be defeated, I won't be dope
In the darkest days, I find my fire
I won't be extinguished, I won't tire

In the silence, I hear my soul
I won't be silenced, I won't be whole
In the silence, I find my path
I won't be lost, I won't be bath

In the darkest days, I find my peace
I won't be shattered, I won't cease
In the darkest days, I find my light
I won't be broken, I won't be night
