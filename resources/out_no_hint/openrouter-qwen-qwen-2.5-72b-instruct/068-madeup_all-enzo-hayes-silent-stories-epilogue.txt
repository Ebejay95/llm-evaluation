In the quiet of the night, I hear the silent stories,
Whispers of the past, echoes of the memories.
The moon casts its glow, the stars they keep watch,
In this final chapter, the truth begins to hatch.

The words unsaid, the secrets untold,
Lingering in the shadows, where the brave ones fold.
But now the silence breaks, the silence fades,
As the epilogue unfolds, the hidden shades.

A life of whispers, a tale of the hushed,
The silent stories, in the darkness they rushed.
Yet here in the end, the silence is gone,
And the truth of the silent stories is drawn.
