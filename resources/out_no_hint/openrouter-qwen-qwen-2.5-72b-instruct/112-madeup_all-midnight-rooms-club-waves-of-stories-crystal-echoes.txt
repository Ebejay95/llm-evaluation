In the midnight rooms club, waves of stories unfold  
Crystal echoes whisper secrets, in the shadows they hold  
Dancing lights and fleeting dreams, where the past and present meet  
Silent tales of joy and pain, in the corners they greet  

Echoes of laughter, echoes of tears  
Through the crystal walls, memories appear  
Shadows dance with the moonlight,  
In the midnight rooms club, the night feels so right  

Waves of stories, crashing and flowing  
In the silence, hearts start glowing  
Crystal reflections, a mirror to the soul  
In the midnight rooms club, we find our goal  

Whispers of love, whispers of fear  
In the crystal echoes, they all come near  
The room spins with each heartbeat,  
In the midnight rooms club, the night won't let us leave  

Waves of stories, endless and free  
Crystal echoes, set our spirits to be  
In the midnight rooms club, we're lost in the sea  
Of tales that bind us, eternally
