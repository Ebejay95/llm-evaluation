In the quiet of the night, the city sleeps so tight
Paper skylines, dreams align, under the moon's soft light
Whispers float, in the air, a secret that's shared
Crimson scenes, in the mind, where the shadows intertwine

Lost in thought, in the glow, where the world seems to slow
Paper skylines, dreams align, where the heart finds its sign
Echoes fade, in the night, a story that's right
Crimson scenes, in the mind, where the dreams are defined

In the silence, we find, the answers we left behind
Paper skylines, dreams align, where the truth is designed
Memories fade, in the light, but the feeling remains
Crimson scenes, in the mind, where the heart still sustains
