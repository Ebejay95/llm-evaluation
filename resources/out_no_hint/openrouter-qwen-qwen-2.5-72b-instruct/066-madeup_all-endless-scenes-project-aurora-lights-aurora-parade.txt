In the night sky, the colors dance,
Aurora lights, a wondrous chance.
Rays of green and hints of pink,
A symphony of light, so brisk.

We chase the glow, we feel the cold,
The stars above, they tell us bold.
A parade of lights, a cosmic show,
In the darkness, they softly flow.

Endless scenes, a fleeting sight,
Captured moments, pure delight.
The world below, in silent awe,
As nature's art, we see and draw.
