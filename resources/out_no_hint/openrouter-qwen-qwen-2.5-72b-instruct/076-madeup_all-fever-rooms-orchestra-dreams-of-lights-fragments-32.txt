In the quiet halls of the night,
Whispers dance with the shadows,
Fragments of dreams, lost and found,
In the silence, they softly echo.

Lights flicker, distant and warm,
Guiding the way through the dark,
Memories float, like fallen leaves,
In the stillness, they gently spark.

Echoes of laughter, echoes of tears,
Moments that linger, moments that fade,
In the fever rooms, we find our peace,
Where the dreams of lights are made.
