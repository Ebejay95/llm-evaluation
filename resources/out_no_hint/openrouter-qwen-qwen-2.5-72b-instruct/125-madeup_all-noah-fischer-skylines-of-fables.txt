I walk the line where the city ends and the wild begins
Where the skyscrapers fade into the trees
I hear the whispers of the old world in the rustling leaves
And the stories of the ones who came before

In the skylines of fables, I find my way
Where the past and the present dance in the fading light
I chase the shadows of the forgotten dreams
And the echoes of the songs that once filled the night

I stand on the edge of the world I know
Where the concrete meets the earth below
I see the beauty in the broken parts
And the hope that lies in the beating hearts

In the skylines of fables, I find my peace
Where the stars and the city lights share the sky
I hold the memories of the ones who dared to dream
And the promise of a future where we can all fly
