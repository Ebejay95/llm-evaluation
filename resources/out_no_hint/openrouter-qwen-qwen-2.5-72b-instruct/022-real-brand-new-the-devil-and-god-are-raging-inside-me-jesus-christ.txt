I am the one who's broken
I am the one who's whole
I am the one who's lost
I am the one who's found
I am the one who's crying
I am the one who's laughing
I am the one who's living
I am the one who's dying
I am the one who's screaming
I am the one who's silent
I am the one who's hurting
I am the one who's healing
I am the one who's empty
I am the one who's full
I am the one who's nothing
I am the one who's all
I am the one who's falling
I am the one who's flying
I am the one who's living
I am the one who's dying
I am the one who's broken
I am the one who's whole
I am the one who's lost
I am the one who's found
I am the one who's crying
I am the one who's laughing
I am the one who's living
I am the one who's dying
I am the one who's screaming
I am the one who's silent
I am the one who's hurting
I am the one who's healing
I am the one who's empty
I am the one who's full
I am the one who's nothing
I am the one who's all
I am the one who's falling
I am the one who's flying
I am the one who's living
I am the one who's dying
I am the one who's broken
I am the one who's whole
I am the one who's lost
I am the one who's found
I am the one who's crying
I am the one who's laughing
I am the one who's living
I am the one who's dying
I am the one who's screaming
I am the one who's silent
I am the one who's hurting
I am the one who's healing
I am the one who's empty
I am the one who's full
I am the one who's nothing
I am the one who's all
