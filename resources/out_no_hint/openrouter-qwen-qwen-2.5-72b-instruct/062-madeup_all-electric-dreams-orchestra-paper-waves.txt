In the dark of night, I saw a light
It shone so bright, it filled my sight
I followed it, I didn’t know why
It led me to a place up high

Electric dreams, they dance and play
In the shadows where the moonlight stays
I reached out, but it slipped away
Left me wondering, what did it say

In the silence, I heard a sound
A melody that echoed all around
It called to me, it pulled me in
I felt the rhythm, I felt the spin

Electric dreams, they weave and sway
In the silence where the stars delay
I followed it, I didn’t know where
But it led me to a world so rare

In the dark of night, I found a way
To chase the light, to seize the day
Electric dreams, they guide my path
In the darkness, they give me strength, they give me strength
