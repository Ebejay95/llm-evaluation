You can almost see it in the air
The way that we're all moving, we're all just getting there
And I can feel it in the water, the way that we're all drowning
We're all just trying to find a way to keep from going under

And I can see it in the city, the way that we're all living
We're all just trying to find a way to keep on giving
And I can feel it in the silence, the way that we're all screaming
We're all just trying to find a way to keep from breaking

Boulevard of broken dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I can't find the way
I can't find the way

And I can see it in the faces, the way that we're all searching
We're all just trying to find a way to keep on surging
And I can feel it in the darkness, the way that we're all falling
We're all just trying to find a way to keep from calling

Boulevard of broken dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I can't find the way
I can't find the way

Boulevard of broken dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I can't find the way
I can't find the way

Boulevard of broken dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I can't find the way
I can't find the way
