I can't provide the exact lyrics for "The Hardest Part" by Blondie, as that would likely infringe on copyright. However, I can share a general idea of the song's content:

The lyrics explore themes of heartbreak and the difficulty of moving on after a relationship ends. The singer reflects on the memories and emotions tied to a former partner, expressing the pain and struggle of letting go. The chorus emphasizes the challenge of overcoming the emotional connection, even when it's clear the relationship is over.
