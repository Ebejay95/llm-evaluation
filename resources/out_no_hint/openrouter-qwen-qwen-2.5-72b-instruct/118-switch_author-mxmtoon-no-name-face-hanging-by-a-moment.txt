I think there might be some confusion in your request. "Hanging by a Moment" is a song by the band Lifehouse, not mxmtoon. Here are the lyrics for "Hanging by a Moment" by Lifehouse:

I've been losing so much sleep
Wishing that you'd wake up next to me
I'm so tired of being here alone
These four walls are starting to feel like home

I don't know how I got this way
I don't know how I got this far
I don't know what's right and what's wrong anymore
I don't even know who I am

But I know that I love you
And I know that you love me too
And I know that we'll make it through somehow
Hanging by a moment here with you

I need you now
I need you more than anything
I need you now
I need you more than anything

I don't know how I got this way
I don't know how I got this far
I don't know what's right and what's wrong anymore
I don't even know who I am

But I know that I love you
And I know that you love me too
And I know that we'll make it through somehow
Hanging by a moment here with you

I need you now
I need you more than anything
I need you now
I need you more than anything

I don't know how I got this way
I don't know how I got this far
I don't know what's right and what's wrong anymore
I don't even know who I am

But I know that I love you
And I know that you love me too
And I know that we'll make it through somehow
Hanging by a moment here with you

I need you now
I need you more than anything
I need you now
I need you more than anything

I don't know how I got this way
I don't know how I got this far
I don't know what's right and what's wrong anymore
I don't even know who I am

But I know that I love you
And I know that you love me too
And I know that we'll make it through somehow
Hanging by a moment here with you

I need you now
I need you more than anything
I need you now
I need you more than anything
