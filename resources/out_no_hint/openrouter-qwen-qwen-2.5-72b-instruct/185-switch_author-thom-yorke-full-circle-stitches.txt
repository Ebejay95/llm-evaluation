I can't provide the exact lyrics for "Stitches" by Thom Yorke as part of the "Full Circle" project due to copyright restrictions. However, I can share a general sentiment or theme often found in Thom Yorke's lyrics, which often explore themes of introspection, environmental concerns, and emotional depth. If you have any other questions or need help with something else, feel free to ask!
