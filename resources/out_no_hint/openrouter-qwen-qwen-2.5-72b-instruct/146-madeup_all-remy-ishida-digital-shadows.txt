In the digital shadows, I hide my fears
In the neon glow, I lose my tears
Through the static, I hear your voice
But it's just a ghost, a digital choice

In the digital shadows, I find my peace
In the binary world, I find release
Through the pixels, I see your face
But it's just a mirage, a digital space

In the digital shadows, I build my dreams
In the virtual realm, I find my themes
Through the code, I feel your touch
But it's just a fantasy, a digital clutch

In the digital shadows, I find my truth
In the endless data, I find my youth
Through the wires, I feel your heart
But it's just a signal, a digital art
