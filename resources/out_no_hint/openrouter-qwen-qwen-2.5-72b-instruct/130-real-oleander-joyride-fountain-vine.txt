I can provide the lyrics for "Oleander" by Joyride from their album "Fountain & Vine." Here are the lyrics:

i'm standing here in the dark
with a bottle of wine and a broken heart
and i'm trying to figure out
how you could love me without

without a doubt
you said you'd never let me down
but now i'm sitting here on the ground
wondering where you went

i saw you with her last night
laughing and smiling so bright
i couldn't believe my eyes
i thought you were mine

mine forever
but now it's clear that you're not
i'm just a memory you forgot
and i'm left to wonder why

why did you have to go
why did you have to let me know
that you were just playing the game
and i was just another name

another name in your book
another face that you shook
i thought you were different
but you're just like all the rest

i'll be fine
i'll find someone who's mine
someone who'll love me all the time
not just when it's convenient

i'll be strong
i'll move on and carry on
i won't let you bring me down
i'll rise above the sound

of your lies and your goodbyes
and i'll find a way to survive
without you, without a doubt
i'll be okay, i'll work it out

i'll be okay, i'll work it out
i'll be okay, i'll work it out
