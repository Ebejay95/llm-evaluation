In the crimson scenes where shadows play,
A black line marks the fading day.
Whispers linger in the twilight's breath,
Echoes of a story left unsaid.

Through the mist, a figure roams,
Silent steps on ancient grounds.
Memories etched in stone and bone,
A tale of sorrow, a heart unbound.

The black line stretches far and wide,
Guiding souls to the other side.
In the crimson scenes, they find their fate,
Where light and darkness intertwine.

Fading fables, whispers lost,
In the wind that softly blows.
The black line remains, a silent guide,
To where the forgotten stories lie.
