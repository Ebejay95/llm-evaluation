Let go of what you're holding on to
Restless hearts, they beat in time
Let go of what you're running from
Restless minds, they never sleep

We're all just trying to find our place
In this world that's spinning round and round
But sometimes we get lost along the way
And we forget to let our feet touch ground

Let go of what you're holding on to
Restless hearts, they beat in time
Let go of what you're running from
Restless minds, they never sleep

We're chasing after something more
But it's always just a little bit too far
Maybe we should stop and take a breath
And realize how much we've come so far

Let go of what you're holding on to
Restless hearts, they beat in time
Let go of what you're running from
Restless minds, they never sleep

We'll find our way, we'll find our peace
If we learn to let the tension go
Restless hearts, they'll find their home
When we learn to let our spirits flow
