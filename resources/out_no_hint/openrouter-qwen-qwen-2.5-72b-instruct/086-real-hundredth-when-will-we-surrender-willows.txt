When will we surrender
To the willows that bend
When will we surrender
To the rivers that mend

When will we surrender
To the mountains that mend
When will we surrender
To the willows that bend

When will we surrender
To the silence that speaks
When will we surrender
To the shadows that creep

When will we surrender
To the light that we seek
When will we surrender
To the willows that bend

When will we surrender
To the love that we find
When will we surrender
To the willows that bind

When will we surrender
To the peace that we need
When will we surrender
To the willows that feed

When will we surrender
To the willows that bend
When will we surrender
To the willows that mend
