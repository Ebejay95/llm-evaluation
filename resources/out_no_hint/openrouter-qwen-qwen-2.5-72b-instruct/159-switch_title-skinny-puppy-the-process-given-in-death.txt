Given in death, I find my breath
In the silence, I hear the truth
The process, it's never complete
In the darkness, I find the light

Given in death, I find my way
Through the shadows, I see the day
The process, it's never still
In the silence, I find my will

Given in death, I find my form
Through the void, I take my turn
The process, it's ever-changing
In the darkness, I find my range

Given in death, I find my voice
Through the silence, I make my choice
The process, it's always moving
In the shadows, I find my groove

Given in death, I find my peace
Through the chaos, I find release
The process, it's never ending
In the darkness, I find my friend
