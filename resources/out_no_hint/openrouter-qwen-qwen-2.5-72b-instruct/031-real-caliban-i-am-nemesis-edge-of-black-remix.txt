In the shadows where the light dares not tread  
I am the harbinger of your impending dread  
With every step, the ground beneath you cracks  
I am the storm that leaves no trace, no tracks  

Whispers in the dark, the silence speaks  
My presence felt, but never seen, it creeps  
The weight of judgment, the scales tip with fate  
I am the end, the final debate  

Edge of black, where darkness reigns  
Your fears awaken, your courage wanes  
I am the voice that echoes through the night  
I am the shadow that consumes the light  

Every lie, every sin, exposed to the core  
I am the fire that will leave you sore  
The edge of black, the line you dare not cross  
I am the reaper, the one who takes the loss  

In the silence, my power grows  
The edge of black, the place where shadows flow  
I am the nemesis, the one you cannot fight  
I am the darkness, the eternal night
