I'll provide the lyrics for "Lucid Dreams" by Juice WRLD and "One By One" by Sia, but I couldn't find any song titled "Yota." Here are the requested lyrics:

**Lucid Dreams**

I been down this road so many times before
I'ma keep it movin', I ain't never learnin' my lesson
I know you're bad, but I can't help myself
I'm in a trance, I can't nobody else

I'm in a daze, I'm in a dream
I'm in a haze, I'm in a scheme
I'm in a zone, I'm in a theme
I'm in a trance, I'm in a stream

I been down this road so many times before
I'ma keep it movin', I ain't never learnin' my lesson
I know you're bad, but I can't help myself
I'm in a trance, I can't nobody else

I'm in a daze, I'm in a dream
I'm in a haze, I'm in a scheme
I'm in a zone, I'm in a theme
I'm in a trance, I'm in a stream

I been down this road so many times before
I'ma keep it movin', I ain't never learnin' my lesson
I know you're bad, but I can't help myself
I'm in a trance, I can't nobody else

I'm in a daze, I'm in a dream
I'm in a haze, I'm in a scheme
I'm in a zone, I'm in a theme
I'm in a trance, I'm in a stream

**One By One**

I'm not afraid to fall apart
I'm not afraid to feel the pain
I'm not afraid to let my heart
Break into a million pieces again

I'm not afraid to lose control
I'm not afraid to be alone
I'm not afraid to let it show
That I'm not as strong as I pretend

I'm not afraid to take the blame
I'm not afraid to play the game
I'm not afraid to walk away
If that's what it takes to make it right

I'm not afraid to say goodbye
I'm not afraid to close my eyes
I'm not afraid to let you go
One by one, I'll let you go

I'm not afraid to face the truth
I'm not afraid to start anew
I'm not afraid to take the first step
Even if it means I might stumble too

I'm not afraid to be the one
Who stands up when the world is done
I'm not afraid to be the one
Who picks up all the broken pieces

I'm not afraid to say goodbye
I'm not afraid to close my eyes
I'm not afraid to let you go
One by one, I'll let you go

I'm not afraid to be the one
Who stands up when the world is done
I'm not afraid to be the one
Who picks up all the broken pieces

I'm not afraid to say goodbye
I'm not afraid to close my eyes
I'm not afraid to let you go
One by one, I'll let you go

I'm not afraid to be the one
Who stands up when the world is done
I'm not afraid to be the one
Who picks up all the broken pieces

One by one, I'll let you go
One by one, I'll let you go
One by one, I'll let you go
One by one, I'll let you go
