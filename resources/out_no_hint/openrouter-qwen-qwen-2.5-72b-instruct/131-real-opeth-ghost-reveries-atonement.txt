In the shadow of the mountain, I stand
With the weight of the world in my hand
The sky is a canvas of sorrow and pain
And the wind, it whispers my name

I am the keeper of secrets untold
The guardian of the stories of old
In the silence, I hear the cries
Of the souls that have long since died

Atonement, the path that I tread
Through the darkness, through the dead
I seek the light that I have lost
In the shadows, I am the most

The river of time, it flows so cold
Through the valleys, through the gold
I am the bridge that spans the divide
Between the living and the other side

In the silence, I find my peace
In the darkness, I find release
Atonement, the path that I choose
To find the light, to break the noose
