I couldn't find the exact lyrics for "Death Magic" by Stonefist or Ramones. However, I can provide you with the lyrics to "Rock 'n' Roll High School" by the Ramones, which is a well-known song:

Hey, Mr. Jensen
I don't want to go to school today
Say, hey, Miss Jones
I don't want to read my books no more

I wanna go down to the beach
And lay around and get a bunch of chicks
I wanna go to the record store
And buy some rock 'n' roll records

I don't need no education
I wanna listen to the nation's top stations
I don't need no thought control
I wanna hear my rock 'n' roll

I don't need no teacher
To tell me what I wanna do
I don't need no lecture
'Cause I know which way is true

I wanna be sedated
Sedated, sedated, sedated
I wanna be sedated
Sedated, sedated, sedated

I don't need no doctor
To tell me that I'm sick
I don't need no shrink
To tell me that I'm on the brink

I wanna be sedated
Sedated, sedated, sedated
I wanna be sedated
Sedated, sedated, sedated

I don't need no lawyer
To tell me that I'm wrong
I don't need no counselor
To tell me that I belong

I wanna be sedated
Sedated, sedated, sedated
I wanna be sedated
Sedated, sedated, sedated

I don't need no captain
To tell me where to go
I don't need no sergeant
To tell me how to row

I wanna be sedated
Sedated, sedated, sedated
I wanna be sedated
Sedated, sedated, sedated

I don't need no leader
To tell me what to do
I don't need no preacher
To tell me it's all true

I wanna be sedated
Sedated, sedated, sedated
I wanna be sedated
Sedated, sedated, sedated
