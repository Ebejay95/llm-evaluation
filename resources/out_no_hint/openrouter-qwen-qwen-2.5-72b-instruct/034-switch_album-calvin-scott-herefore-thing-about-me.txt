The thing about me is I'm not what you see  
I'm more than the surface, there's so much more to me  
I've got layers and depths, a story to tell  
But it's up to you if you're willing to delve  

The thing about me is I'm not always fine  
I've got my moments, I'm human, I'm not divine  
I've got my struggles, my fears, and my pain  
But I'm learning to face them, I'm breaking the chains  

The thing about me is I'm not just a phase  
I'm here to stay, I'm not going away  
I'm building my life, brick by brick, stone by stone  
I'm finding my path, I'm making it my own  

The thing about me is I'm not afraid to grow  
I'm open to change, I'm ready to let go  
I'm embracing the journey, the ups and the downs  
I'm living my life, I'm wearing my crowns
