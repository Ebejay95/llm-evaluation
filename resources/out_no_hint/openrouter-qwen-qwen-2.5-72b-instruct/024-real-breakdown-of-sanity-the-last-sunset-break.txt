I stand alone in the dark
Lost in a world that's torn apart
The silence screams inside my head
The pain, the fear, the tears I've shed

Shadows dance upon the wall
Memories haunt me, one and all
The weight of guilt, the chains of shame
A prison built from broken dreams

I try to break free from the chains
But the darkness pulls me back again
The light is fading, I can't see
The path that leads to sanity

The last sunset, a final breath
A moment lost, a life of death
The world around me fades to black
The end of hope, the end of fact

I'm falling, falling, can't hold on
The breakdown of my sanity's gone
The last sunset, the final light
The end of all that's wrong and right
