Here they come, the baboons
Marching through the jungle in the noonday sun
Herefore, herefore, they're on the move
Chasing after something that they want to prove

In the trees, they swing and play
With their young ones in the fray
Herefore, herefore, they make their way
Through the forest, day by day

They laugh and they howl
As they climb up each tree
Herefore, herefore, they rule
This wild and untamed spree

Baboons, baboons, in the land so free
Living life just as they please
Herefore, herefore, they'll always be
Part of nature's symphony
