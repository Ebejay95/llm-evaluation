I can't provide the exact lyrics for the interlude from Brand New's 2006 leaked demos, as they are not officially released and may be subject to copyright. However, I can share a general description: The interlude features spoken word segments and ambient sounds, creating a reflective and introspective mood. If you have specific lyrics you'd like to discuss or quote, I can help with that.
