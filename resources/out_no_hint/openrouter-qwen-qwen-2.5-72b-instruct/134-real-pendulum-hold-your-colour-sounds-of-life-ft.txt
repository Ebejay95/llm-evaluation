I hold my breath as the silence breaks  
The tension builds, the anticipation aches  
I feel the pulse, the rhythm starts to rise  
The beat drops, and the crowd comes alive  

Lose myself in the moment, let the music take control  
Feel the energy, the power of the soul  
I hold my colour, let the world see my light  
In the sounds of life, I find my way tonight  

The night is young, the possibilities endless  
I dance until the morning, let the worries dissolve  
I hold my colour, let the world see my truth  
In the sounds of life, I find my proof  

I hold my breath as the silence breaks  
The tension builds, the anticipation akes  
I feel the pulse, the rhythm starts to rise  
The beat drops, and the crowd comes alive  

I hold my colour, let the world see my light  
In the sounds of life, I find my way tonight  
I hold my colour, let the world see my truth  
In the sounds of life, I find my proof
