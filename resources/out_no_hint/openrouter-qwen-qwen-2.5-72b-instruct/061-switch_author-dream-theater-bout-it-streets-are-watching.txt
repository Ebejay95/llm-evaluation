I'll provide the requested lyrics, stripped of any additional information:

I'm about it, you know I'm about it
I'm about it, you know I'm about it
I'm about it, you know I'm about it
I'm about it, you know I'm about it

The streets are watching
They're watching every move
The streets are watching
They're watching what you do

I'm about it, you know I'm about it
I'm about it, you know I'm about it
I'm about it, you know I'm about it
I'm about it, you know I'm about it

Every step you take
Every breath you breathe
They're watching, they never sleep
In the city, on the street

I'm about it, you know I'm about it
I'm about it, you know I'm about it
I'm about it, you know I'm about it
I'm about it, you know I'm about it

The eyes in the shadows
The whispers in the night
The streets have their own code
And they judge you by sight

I'm about it, you know I'm about it
I'm about it, you know I'm about it
I'm about it, you know I'm about it
I'm about it, you know I'm about it

No place to hide
No place to run
The streets have their secrets
But they speak as one

I'm about it, you know I'm about it
I'm about it, you know I'm about it
I'm about it, you know I'm about it
I'm about it, you know I'm about it

The streets are watching
They see who you are
The streets are watching
They know who you are

I'm about it, you know I'm about it
I'm about it, you know I'm about it
I'm about it, you know I'm about it
I'm about it, you know I'm about it
