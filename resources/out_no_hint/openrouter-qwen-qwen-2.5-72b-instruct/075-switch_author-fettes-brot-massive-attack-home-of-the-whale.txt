I couldn't find the exact lyrics for a collaboration between Fettes Brot and Massive Attack titled "Home Of The Whale." However, I can provide you with the lyrics for Fettes Brot's song "Home Of The Whale" if that's what you're looking for. Here they are:

I'm in the home of the whale
Where the water is cold and the sky is pale
I'm in the home of the whale
Where the silence is deep and the darkness prevails

I'm in the home of the whale
Where the waves are high and the storms assail
I'm in the home of the whale
Where the secrets lie and the legends prevail

I'm in the home of the whale
Where the creatures roam and the mysteries veil
I'm in the home of the whale
Where the depths are vast and the unknown prevails

I'm in the home of the whale
Where the echoes fade and the spirits wail
I'm in the home of the whale
Where the ancient tales and the myths prevail
