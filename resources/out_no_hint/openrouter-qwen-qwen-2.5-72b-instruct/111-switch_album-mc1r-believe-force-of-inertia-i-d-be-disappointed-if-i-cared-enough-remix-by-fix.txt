I'd be disappointed if I cared enough
To let you know that I'm not okay
I'd be disappointed if I cared enough
To let you see me break today

I won't let you in, I won't let you win
I won't show my pain, I won't show my fear
I'd be disappointed if I cared enough
To let you know how much I need you here

I won't fall apart, I won't lose my heart
I won't give you power, I won't give you sway
I'd be disappointed if I cared enough
To let you take it all away

I won't let you see, I won't let you breathe
The air that I breathe, the life that I lead
I'd be disappointed if I cared enough
To let you know what's going through my head

I won't let you down, I won't let you drown
In the sea of lies, in the storm of deceit
I'd be disappointed if I cared enough
To let you think that I could ever forget

I won't let you in, I won't let you win
I won't show my pain, I won't show my fear
I'd be disappointed if I cared enough
To let you know how much I need you here

I won't fall apart, I won't lose my heart
I won't give you power, I won't give you sway
I'd be disappointed if I cared enough
To let you take it all away
