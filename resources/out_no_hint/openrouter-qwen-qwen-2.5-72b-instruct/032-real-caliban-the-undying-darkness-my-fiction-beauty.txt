In the shadows where the light dares not tread  
My fiction beauty, you dwell in my head  
Eyes like the void, where stars dare to hide  
In your embrace, I find my dark side  

Whispers of silence, where secrets are kept  
My fiction beauty, in darkness you wept  
A world of shadows, where dreams are but lies  
In your presence, my fears all subside  

A tale of the night, where the moon sheds its light  
My fiction beauty, you dance through the night  
A symphony played in the heart of the storm  
In your eyes, I find my eternal form  

In the depths of the abyss, where hope dares to die  
My fiction beauty, you are my only sigh  
A world of despair, where love is but a dream  
In your arms, I find my undying seam
