I'll provide the lyrics for "White Light" by The Hope Division, as requested:

In the white light of day
We stand exposed and bare
Our secrets lie in wait
To be revealed and shared

In the white light of day
The truth is laid on show
No place to hide or run
From what we came to know

Chorus:
Stick to your guns
Hold your ground
Don't let the shadows
Bring you down

Verses:
When the night falls
We're safe from prying eyes
But in the morning
All our lies collide

The world can be cruel
When it sees who we are
But in the white light
We find a way to start

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:
Though the path may be hard
And the journey long
In the white light
We belong

(Repeat Chorus)
