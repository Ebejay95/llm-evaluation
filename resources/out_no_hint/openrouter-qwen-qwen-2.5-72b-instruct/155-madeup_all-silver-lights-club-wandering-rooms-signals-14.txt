In the wandering rooms of the Silver Lights Club  
Signals flash, a neon pulse  
Echoes of laughter, shadows in the crowd  
Lost in the glow, we dance without a sound  

Whispers float through the air  
Secrets shared in the dark  
Every step, every stare  
A silent code, a secret mark  

The music pounds, a heartbeat strong  
Guiding us through the night  
In this place where we belong  
We find our light, we find our might  

But as the dawn begins to break  
And the signals start to fade  
We'll hold on tight, for old time's sake  
In the wandering rooms, we'll never stray
