In the silence of the night, I hear the poet's voice so clear
Whispering secrets of the heart, in a world that's cold and stark
He speaks of love and loss, of dreams that never came to pass
And as the pendulum swings, I'm drawn into his dark embrace

The poet and the pendulum, a dance of light and shade
In the shadows of the night, their story is played
A tale of passion and despair, of beauty and the beast
And as the pendulum swings, the poet's words are released

In the silence of the night, I feel the poet's pain so deep
His words are like a double-edged sword, they cut and they heal
He speaks of hope and fear, of the darkness and the light
And as the pendulum swings, I'm lost in his endless flight

The poet and the pendulum, a dance of light and shade
In the shadows of the night, their story is played
A tale of passion and despair, of beauty and the beast
And as the pendulum swings, the poet's words are freed

In the silence of the night, I hear the poet's voice once more
His words are like a guiding light, in a world that's dark and sore
He speaks of life and death, of the cycles that we all must face
And as the pendulum swings, I find my own grace

The poet and the pendulum, a dance of light and shade
In the shadows of the night, their story is played
A tale of passion and despair, of beauty and the beast
And as the pendulum swings, the poet's words will never fade
