Whispers in the dark, secrets untold  
Echoes of the past, stories of old  
In the shadows, where the light barely glows  
Mina Sato walks, where the hidden echoes flow  

Silent footsteps, on the cobbled stone  
Memories linger, where the heart has grown  
Through the mist and fog, she finds her way  
Guided by the echoes, of a forgotten day  

In the quiet halls, where time stands still  
She hears the voices, of those who dwell  
In the depths of silence, where dreams are kept  
Mina Sato listens, to the secrets they wept  

Echoes of love, echoes of pain  
Echoes of hope, that break the chain  
In the hidden places, where shadows meet  
Mina Sato finds, the truth she seeks  

Whispers in the dark, secrets untold  
Echoes of the past, stories of old  
In the shadows, where the light barely glows  
Mina Sato walks, where the hidden echoes flow
