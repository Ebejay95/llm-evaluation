In the flow of memory, we drift away
Echoes of the past, in the light of day
Shadows dance, in the plastic noise
Sunnypsyop, where the memories flow

Whispers in the wind, a distant call
Fragments of a dream, in the memory hall
Lost in the haze, of the plastic sound
Sunnypsyop, where the moments are found

In the flow of time, we find our peace
Moments fleeting, in the plastic release
Sunnypsyop, where the memories flow
In the flow, in the flow, we let go
