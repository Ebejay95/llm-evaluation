In the green sky, the lights of motors fly
Crimson patterns in the air, they never die
Shadows dance beneath the glow, a silent symphony
Whispers float on the breeze, a memory

Through the haze, a distant call
Echoes through the night, a siren's fall
The world below, a tapestry of dreams
Where the lights of motors stream

In the green sky, the stars align
A path unseen, a secret sign
Crimson patterns weave their way
Guiding us through the break of day

The lights of motors, a beacon bright
Illuminating the darkest night
In the green sky, we find our fate
Tracing paths that never break
