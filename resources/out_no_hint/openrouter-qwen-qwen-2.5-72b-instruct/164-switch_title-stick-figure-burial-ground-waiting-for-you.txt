I'm here in the burial ground  
Waiting for you to come around  
The sky is dark, the moon is high  
I feel your presence, but you're still shy  

The wind whispers through the trees  
Echoes of memories, it seems  
Your shadow dances on the cold stone  
But I'm not alone, I'm waiting for you alone  

Time ticks by, the night grows old  
My heart beats steady, bold and cold  
In this place where spirits dwell  
I know you'll come, I can tell  

The earth trembles, a soft sigh  
Your hand reaches out from the nether sky  
In the silence, our souls entwine  
Here in the burial ground, waiting for you, mine
