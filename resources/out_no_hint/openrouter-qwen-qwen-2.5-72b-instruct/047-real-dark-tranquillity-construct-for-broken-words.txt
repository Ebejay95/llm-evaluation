For broken words and shattered dreams  
We stand alone, we're not what we seem  
In the silence, the truth will be heard  
The lies unravel, the masks are blurred  

A world of chaos, a fragile state  
Where nothing's certain, nothing's fate  
We build our castles on sinking sand  
And hope they'll last, but they won't stand  

The weight of shadows, the cost of light  
We pay the price, we bear the fight  
In the ruins of what once was real  
We find the strength to break the seal  

For broken words and silent cries  
We seek the answers in the skies  
But the heavens offer no reply  
We must find our way, or we will die  

The path is dark, the journey long  
But in the darkness, we belong  
We'll forge ahead, we'll make our stand  
For broken words, we'll take command
