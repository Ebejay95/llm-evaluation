In the terminal, I'm just a ghost in the machine
In the terminal, I'm just a whisper in the wind
In the terminal, I'm just a shadow in the light
In the terminal, I'm just a memory of the night

In the terminal, I'm just a dream in the dark
In the terminal, I'm just a spark in the park
In the terminal, I'm just a trace in the sand
In the terminal, I'm just a breath in the land

In the terminal, I'm just a sigh in the air
In the terminal, I'm just a tear in the stare
In the terminal, I'm just a pulse in the vein
In the terminal, I'm just a whisper of pain

In the terminal, I'm just a note in the song
In the terminal, I'm just a word that's been wrong
In the terminal, I'm just a line in the book
In the terminal, I'm just a mark on the hook

In the terminal, I'm just a flicker in the flame
In the terminal, I'm just a moment in the game
In the terminal, I'm just a fragment of the whole
In the terminal, I'm just a story that's been told
