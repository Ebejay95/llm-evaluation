We are the ones who stand alone in the dark  
We are the ones who never fall apart  
We are the ones who keep the secrets safe  
We are the ones who break the chains

We are the ones who light the fire in the night  
We are the ones who fight the endless fight  
We are the ones who hear the whispers clear  
We are the ones who live in fear

We are the ones who build the walls so high  
We are the ones who touch the sky  
We are the ones who chase the ghosts away  
We are the ones who stay

We are the ones who walk the line  
We are the ones who take the time  
We are the ones who see the truth  
We are the ones who seek the proof

We are the ones who feel the pain  
We are the ones who break the chain  
We are the ones who find the way  
We are the ones who lead the fray

We are the ones who stand alone in the dark  
We are the ones who never fall apart  
We are the ones who keep the secrets safe  
We are the ones who break the chains
