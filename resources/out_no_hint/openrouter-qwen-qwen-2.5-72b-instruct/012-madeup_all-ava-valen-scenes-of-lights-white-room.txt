In the white room, the lights are dim
Echoes of a distant hymn
Shadows dance upon the wall
In the silence, I hear it all

Memories float, like whispers soft
In this place where time is oft
Lost in the glow, the quiet space
Where the past and present embrace

White room, where dreams are spun
Where the light and dark have one
In this room, I find my peace
In the quiet, I am released
