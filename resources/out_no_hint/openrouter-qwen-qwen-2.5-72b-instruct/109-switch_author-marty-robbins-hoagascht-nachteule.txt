I couldn't find exact matches for "Hoagascht" or "Nachteule" in Marty Robbins' catalog. However, here's a well-known verse from one of his popular songs, "El Paso":

I rode in last night through the border town,
Where the cold wind blows and the moon shines down.
I saw my love dance with another man,
And I knew that I'd never be her man again.
