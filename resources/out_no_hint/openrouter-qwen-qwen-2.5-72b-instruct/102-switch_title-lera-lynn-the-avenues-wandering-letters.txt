Wandering letters in the night
Falling softly like the snow
Whispers carried on the wind
Echoes of a long ago

A story written in the stars
A tale of love and of despair
The avenues we wander down
The paths we choose to take or share

Wandering letters in the light
Floating gently like a dream
Memories that linger on
Moments that we hold so dear

A journey through the heart and soul
A search for what we lost or stole
The avenues we wander down
The paths we choose to make our own

Wandering letters, wandering hearts
Lost in time, yet never apart
The avenues we wander down
The paths we choose, the paths we find
