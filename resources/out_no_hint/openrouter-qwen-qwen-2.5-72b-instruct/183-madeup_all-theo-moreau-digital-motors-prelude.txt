In the glow of neon lights, the city never sleeps
Through the digital haze, the future is here
Pulses and rhythms, machines come alive
In the heart of the grid, the motors ignite

Synthetic dreams, in the wired night
Data streams, in the endless flight
The prelude begins, the journey takes flight
In the world of digital motors, the future is bright
