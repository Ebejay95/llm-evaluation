In the silence of the night,  
A lunar aurora shines so bright,  
Patterns in the sky,  
Dancing with the stars so high.  

Whispers in the wind,  
Echoes of a distant friend,  
Shapes and forms,  
In the darkness they transform.  

The moon casts its glow,  
On the world below,  
A canvas of light,  
In the arms of the night.  

Patterns in the air,  
A symphony so rare,  
A tapestry of dreams,  
Woven from the moon's beams.  

In the silence of the night,  
A lunar aurora shines so bright,  
Patterns in the sky,  
Dancing with the stars so high.
