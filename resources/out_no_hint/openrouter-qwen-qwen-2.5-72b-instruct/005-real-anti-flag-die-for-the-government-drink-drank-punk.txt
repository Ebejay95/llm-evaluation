I'll provide the lyrics from "Die For The Government" by Anti-Flag:

They say that freedom's just around the corner  
But it's a lie, they're just around the corner  
They say that justice will be served in time  
But it's a lie, they're just around the corner  

Chorus:  
Die for the government, die for the state  
Die for the system, die for your fate  
Die for the flag, die for the cause  
Die for the lies, die for the laws  

They say that peace is just around the corner  
But it's a lie, they're just around the corner  
They say that war is fought to keep us free  
But it's a lie, they're just around the corner  

(Repeat Chorus)  

They say that truth is just around the corner  
But it's a lie, they're just around the corner  
They say that power comes from the people  
But it's a lie, they're just around the corner  

(Repeat Chorus)  

Bridge:  
We won't die for the government, we won't die for the state  
We won't die for the system, we won't die for our fate  
We won't die for the flag, we won't die for the cause  
We won't die for the lies, we won't die for the laws  

(Repeat Chorus)
