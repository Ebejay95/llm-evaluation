I'm holding on to you, you're holding on to me
We're holding on to something, but it's not what we need
I'm holding on to you, you're holding on to me
We're holding on to something, but it's not what we need

I'm holding on to you, you're holding on to me
We're holding on to something, but it's not what we need
I'm holding on to you, you're holding on to me
We're holding on to something, but it's not what we need

I'm holding on to you, you're holding on to me
We're holding on to something, but it's not what we need
I'm holding on to you, you're holding on to me
We're holding on to something, but it's not what we need

I'm holding on to you, you're holding on to me
We're holding on to something, but it's not what we need
I'm holding on to you, you're holding on to me
We're holding on to something, but it's not what we need
