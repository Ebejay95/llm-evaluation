I think there might be a bit of confusion in your request. "The Colour and the Shape" is a song by Foo Fighters, not System of a Down. "Everlong" is also by Foo Fighters. Here are the lyrics for "Everlong":

I reach out to you from the edge of insanity
Lord, show me the way
'Cause I'm so far away
I'm so far away
I'm so far away

I need you, I want you
All the more, baby
Can't you see, can't you see
I'm so far away
I'm so far away
I'm so far away

I'm so far away
I'm so far away
I'm so far away

I want to walk with you
On a cloudy day
In fields where the yellow grass grows
Mile after mile
But I'm so far away
I'm so far away
I'm so far away

I need you, I want you
All the more, baby
Can't you see, can't you see
I'm so far away
I'm so far away
I'm so far away

I'm so far away
I'm so far away
I'm so far away

I want to walk with you
On a cloudy day
In fields where the yellow grass grows
Mile after mile
But I'm so far away
I'm so far away
I'm so far away

I need you, I want you
All the more, baby
Can't you see, can't you see
I'm so far away
I'm so far away
I'm so far away

I'm so far away
I'm so far away
I'm so far away

I need you, I want you
All the more, baby
Can't you see, can't you see
I'm so far away
I'm so far away
I'm so far away

I'm so far away
I'm so far away
I'm so far away
