I can't find the exact lyrics for "Maybe Memories" by The Used in their album "Joyride." However, here is a popular song from that album:

I'm just a soul whose intentions are good  
Please don't let me be misunderstood  
I never wanted to hurt you, I never meant to do you wrong  
But I guess if I did, I guess I'll have to carry on

I'm just a soul whose intentions are good  
Please don't let me be misunderstood  

I need someone who's already been  
Where I want to go  
Someone who knows what it means  
To be like me  

I'm just a soul whose intentions are good  
Please don't let me be misunderstood  

I never wanted to hurt you, I never meant to do you wrong  
But I guess if I did, I guess I'll have to carry on  
I never wanted to hurt you, I never meant to do you wrong  
But I guess if I did, I guess I'll have to carry on  

I'm just a soul whose intentions are good  
Please don't let me be misunderstood
