I couldn't find the exact lyrics for "Pubic Fruit" by Still Corners, but here are the lyrics for "Strange Pleasures" by Still Corners:

i'm in love with the way you move
i'm in love with the way you breathe
i'm in love with the way you touch
i'm in love with the way you see

i'm in love with the way you hide
i'm in love with the way you lie
i'm in love with the way you fight
i'm in love with the way you die

i'm in love with the way you're strange
i'm in love with the way you change
i'm in love with the way you're mad
i'm in love with the way you're bad

i'm in love with the way you're wrong
i'm in love with the way you're strong
i'm in love with the way you're free
i'm in love with the way you're me

i'm in love with the way you're mine
i'm in love with the way you shine
i'm in love with the way you're lost
i'm in love with the way you're found

i'm in love with the way you're gone
i'm in love with the way you're young
i'm in love with the way you're old
i'm in love with the way you're bold

i'm in love with the way you're strange
i'm in love with the way you're strange pleasures
