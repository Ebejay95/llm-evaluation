I am the shadow in the dark
The one you fear but can't remark
I am the whisper in your ear
The one you hear but can't make clear

I am the doubt that haunts your mind
The one you try to leave behind
I am the ghost that's always near
The one you feel but can't come near

I am the song you can't recall
The one that echoes through the hall
I am the dream that fades away
The one that leaves you in dismay

I am the shadow zone, the unknown
The one you fear, the one you've grown
To hate and love, to fear and know
I am the shadow, I am the glow
