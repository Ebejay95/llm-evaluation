In the quiet of the night, I hear the whispers of the past
Echoes of a distant dream, where the shadows softly cast
Through the halls of memory, where the fables come to play
I see the scenes unfold, in the light of yesterday

The tales they tell are old, yet they linger in my mind
Of heroes and of villains, of love that never dies
In this place of endless stories, where the truth and lies entwine
I find myself a wanderer, in a world thatâ€™s left behind

The fire burns within me, a flame that never fades
Guiding me through darkness, on a path that seldom strays
For every scene of fable, holds a secret to be found
And in the silence of the night, the answers can be heard around
