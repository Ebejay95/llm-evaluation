In the glow of aurora dreams  
Whispers float on silver streams  
Shadows dance in digital light  
Echoes of the endless night  

Through the veil of neon haze  
Mysteries in code arrays  
Pixels paint the dreamer's tale  
In the realm where dreams prevail  

Aurora's touch, so soft and bright  
Guiding us through the digital night  
In the dreams we find our way  
In the shadows, we stay
