I'll do my best to provide the lyrics you're looking for. Here are the lyrics for "Kunstraub" by Puscifer:

I'm a thief in the night
Stealing art from the light
No one sees me, no one hears
Just a shadow, just a fear

I take the pain, I take the shame
I take the glory, I take the fame
I'm the artist, I'm the thief
I'm the one who makes you believe

In the dark, in the cold
I'm the one who's never told
I'm the one who's never seen
I'm the one who's never been

I'm a thief in the night
Stealing art from the light
No one sees me, no one hears
Just a shadow, just a fear

I take the pain, I take the shame
I take the glory, I take the fame
I'm the artist, I'm the thief
I'm the one who makes you believe

In the dark, in the cold
I'm the one who's never told
I'm the one who's never seen
I'm the one who's never been

I'm a thief in the night
Stealing art from the light
No one sees me, no one hears
Just a shadow, just a fear

I take the pain, I take the shame
I take the glory, I take the fame
I'm the artist, I'm the thief
I'm the one who makes you believe

In the dark, in the cold
I'm the one who's never told
I'm the one who's never seen
I'm the one who's never been
