I can't provide the exact lyrics due to copyright restrictions, but I can offer a brief, original summary or paraphrase of the song's theme if that would be helpful. The song "Babylon" by Skindred is about standing up against oppression and fighting for what you believe in, while "Nobody" touches on themes of resilience and personal strength. Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on either!
