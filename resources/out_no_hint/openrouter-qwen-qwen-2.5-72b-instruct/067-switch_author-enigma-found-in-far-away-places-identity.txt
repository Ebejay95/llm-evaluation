I can provide the lyrics for "Found in Far Away Places" by Enigma, but I don't have the lyrics for "Identity" as it's not a known track by Enigma. Here are the lyrics for "Found in Far Away Places":

In the silence of the night
I hear your voice so clear
Whispers from the other side
Echoes that I hold so dear

Far away places
Where dreams and shadows meet
In the realm of endless grace
Our souls will always be free

Through the mist and mystery
Your presence fills my heart
Guiding me through the journey
To a world where we wonâ€™t part

Far away places
Where light and darkness blend
In the dance of eternity
Our love will never end

In the garden of the mind
We plant the seeds of hope
Nurtured by the gentle wind
That whispers of the scope

Far away places
Where time and space dissolve
In the embrace of the infinite
Our spirits will evolve

In the silence of the night
I feel your touch so near
Across the vast expanse of light
Our bond will always steer

Far away places
Where the soul finds its peace
In the quiet of the universe
Our hearts will never cease
