In the year 2525
If man is still alive
If woman can survive
They may find

In the year 3535
Ain't gonna need to strive
They won't have to push and shove
They'll just live

In the year 4545
There won't be any trouble
'Cause there won't be any people
Just dust

In the year 5757
The sun will shine no more
And the rain will never fall
Just snow

In the year 6868
There won't be any day
No sun will come up to play
Just night

In the year 7070
Man will still be around
But he won't be the same
He'll be lost

In the year 8080
If there's still a planet Earth
And man has found his worth
He'll rise

In the year 9595
Man will learn to fly
But he won't know how to die
Just live

In the year 10,000
Man will see the end
Of all his time and friends
Just space

In the year 2525
If God's a-comin'
He oughta make it by now
Just wait
