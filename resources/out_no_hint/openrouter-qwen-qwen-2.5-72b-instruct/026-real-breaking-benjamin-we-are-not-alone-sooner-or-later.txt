Sooner or later, we will find our way
Through the darkest days, we'll see the light of day
We are not alone, in this life we share
We are not alone, we are everywhere

Sooner or later, we will break the chains
That hold us down, that bring us pain
We are not alone, in the fight we face
We are not alone, we'll find our grace

Sooner or later, we will rise again
From the ashes of the world we've known
We are not alone, in the storm we weather
We are not alone, we'll find each other

Sooner or later, we will heal the scars
From the battles fought, from the broken hearts
We are not alone, in the journey we take
We are not alone, for love's the sake
