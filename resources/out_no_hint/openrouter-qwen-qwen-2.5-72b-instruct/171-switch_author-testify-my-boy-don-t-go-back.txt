I won't go back, I won't go back
To the place where I came from
I won't go back, I won't go back
To the place where I belong

I won't go back, I won't go back
To the place where I was wrong
I won't go back, I won't go back
To the place where I was strong

I won't go back, I won't go back
To the place where I was lost
I won't go back, I won't go back
To the place where I was tossed

I won't go back, I won't go back
To the place where I was free
I won't go back, I won't go back
To the place where I can be

Testify, my boy, don't go back
Don't you ever go back
Testify, my boy, don't go back
Stay on this new track

I won't go back, I won't go back
To the place where I was chained
I won't go back, I won't go back
To the place where I was tamed

I won't go back, I won't go back
To the place where I was bound
I won't go back, I won't go back
To the place where I was found

I won't go back, I won't go back
To the place where I was seen
I won't go back, I won't go back
To the place where I was mean

Testify, my boy, don't go back
Don't you ever go back
Testify, my boy, don't go back
Stay on this new track

I won't go back, I won't go back
To the place where I was hurt
I won't go back, I won't go back
To the place where I was curt

I won't go back, I won't go back
To the place where I was lied
I won't go back, I won't go back
To the place where I was tried

I won't go back, I won't go back
To the place where I was wrong
I won't go back, I won't go back
To the place where I was strong

Testify, my boy, don't go back
Don't you ever go back
Testify, my boy, don't go back
Stay on this new track
