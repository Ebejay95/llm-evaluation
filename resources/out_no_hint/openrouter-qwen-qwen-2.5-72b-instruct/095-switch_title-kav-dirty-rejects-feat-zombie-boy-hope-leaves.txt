Hope leaves, but it's not gone  
It's just hiding in the shadows where we belong  
We're the dirty rejects, the ones they don't want around  
But we'll keep on moving, until we find our ground

Hope leaves, but it's not dead  
It's just waiting for the moment when we rise instead  
We'll break these chains, and we'll break them with pride  
We'll stand tall, and we'll never hide

Hope leaves, but it will return  
When the night is over, and the sun begins to burn  
We'll find our way, through the darkness and the pain  
We'll build a world, where we can love again

Hope leaves, but it's still alive  
In every heart that beats, in every step we stride  
We'll fight the battles, we'll face the fear  
We'll make a future, that's crystal clear

Hope leaves, but it's not lost  
We'll find it in the moments, when we pay the cost  
We'll rise from ashes, we'll turn the tide  
We'll be the ones, who won't be denied
