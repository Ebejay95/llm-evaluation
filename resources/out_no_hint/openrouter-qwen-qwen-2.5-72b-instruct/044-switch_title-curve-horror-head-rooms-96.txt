I can't find the exact lyrics for "Rooms #96" by Curve, Horror Head. However, I can provide a general placeholder for the lyrics:

(Verse 1)
Echoes in the dark, shadows play their part
Whispers in the night, secrets never told
Doors that never open, rooms that hide the truth
Lost in endless corridors, where the silence reigns

(Chorus)
Rooms, rooms, where the horror hides
Rooms, rooms, where the darkness resides
Rooms, rooms, where the silence speaks
Rooms, rooms, where the fear never sleeps

(Verse 2)
Shadows dance on the walls, the air is thick with dread
Every step you take, the silence seems to spread
Doors that lead to nowhere, paths that twist and turn
Trapped in this nightmare, where the light is burned

(Chorus)
Rooms, rooms, where the horror hides
Rooms, rooms, where the darkness resides
Rooms, rooms, where the silence speaks
Rooms, rooms, where the fear never sleeps

(Bridge)
In the heart of the labyrinth, the truth is never clear
Every room a mystery, every step a fear
The horror in the shadows, the silence in the air
Trapped in these rooms, where the darkness is a snare

(Chorus)
Rooms, rooms, where the horror hides
Rooms, rooms, where the darkness resides
Rooms, rooms, where the silence speaks
Rooms, rooms, where the fear never sleeps

(Outro)
In the end, the silence is all that remains
In the rooms, the horror never fades
