I am the way, the truth, the life
No one comes to the Father except through me
I am the resurrection and the life
He who believes in me will live

Even if he dies
He who believes in me will never die
Do you believe this?

Frail words collapse beneath the weight
Of what has been and what remains
A hollow echo of the past
Resounds within these fragile walls

I am the light of the world
Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness
But will have the light of life
I am the bread of life

He who comes to me will never hunger
And he who believes in me will never thirst
Do you believe this?

Frail words collapse beneath the weight
Of what has been and what remains
A hollow echo of the past
Resounds within these fragile walls

I am the good shepherd
The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep
I am the door of the sheep
If anyone enters through me, he will be saved

And will go in and out and find pasture
Do you believe this?

Frail words collapse beneath the weight
Of what has been and what remains
A hollow echo of the past
Resounds within these fragile walls

I am the vine, you are the branches
Whoever abides in me and I in him
He it is that bears much fruit
For apart from me you can do nothing

Do you believe this?
