I'm waiting for the day
When I can lay my body down
And rest in peace forever
In the cold, cold ground
I'm waiting for the day
When I can leave this world behind
And all the pain and suffering
Will be left behind
I'm waiting for the day
When I can join the ones I love
In the place where there's no more
Sorrow or grief
I'm waiting for the day
When I can finally be at peace
In the quiet, peaceful
Burial ground
