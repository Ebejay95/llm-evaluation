I can provide the lyrics from the song "Velvet Waves" by Candlebox, as requested:

I'm just a man with a heart of stone
I don't know what I'm doing here alone
I'm just a man with a heart of gold
I don't know how to be this cold

I'm just a man with a velvet soul
I don't know how to let you go
I'm just a man with a heart of steel
I don't know how to feel

I'm just a man with a heart of fire
I don't know why I can't get higher
I'm just a man with a heart of ice
I don't know how to compromise

I'm just a man with a velvet wave
I don't know how to save the day
I'm just a man with a heart of glass
I don't know how to pass the test

I'm just a man with a velvet wave
I don't know how to save the day
I'm just a man with a heart of stone
I don't know what I'm doing here alone

I'm just a man with a heart of gold
I don't know how to be this cold
I'm just a man with a velvet soul
I don't know how to let you go

I'm just a man with a heart of steel
I don't know how to feel
I'm just a man with a heart of fire
I don't know why I can't get higher

I'm just a man with a heart of ice
I don't know how to compromise
I'm just a man with a heart of glass
I don't know how to pass the test

I'm just a man with a velvet wave
I don't know how to save the day
I'm just a man with a heart of stone
I don't know what I'm doing here alone

I'm just a man with a heart of gold
I don't know how to be this cold
I'm just a man with a velvet soul
I don't know how to let you go

I'm just a man with a heart of steel
I don't know how to feel
I'm just a man with a heart of fire
I don't know why I can't get higher

I'm just a man with a heart of ice
I don't know how to compromise
I'm just a man with a heart of glass
I don't know how to pass the test

I'm just a man with a velvet wave
I don't know how to save the day
I'm just a man with a heart of stone
I don't know what I'm doing here alone

I'm just a man with a heart of gold
I don't know how to be this cold
I'm just a man with a velvet soul
I don't know how to let you go
