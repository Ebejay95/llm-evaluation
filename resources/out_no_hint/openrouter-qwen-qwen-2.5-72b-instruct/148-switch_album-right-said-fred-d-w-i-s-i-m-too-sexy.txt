I'm too sexy for my love
Too sexy for my love
Love's going to leave me
I'm too sexy for my shirt
Too sexy for my shirt
So sexy it hurts
I'm too sexy for my car
Too sexy, you don't even have to go too far
So why don't you come to my house?
I'm too sexy for my hat
What do you think about that?
I'm too sexy for my cat
Too sexy, you don't even have to go too far
So why don't you come to my house?
I'm too sexy for my love
Too sexy for my love
Love's going to leave me
I'm too sexy for my shirt
Too sexy for my shirt
So sexy it hurts
I'm too sexy for my car
Too sexy, you don't even have to go too far
So why don't you come to my house?
I'm too sexy for my hat
What do you think about that?
I'm too sexy for my cat
Too sexy, you don't even have to go too far
So why don't you come to my house?
I'm too sexy for my love
Too sexy for my love
Love's going to leave me
I'm too sexy for my shirt
Too sexy for my shirt
So sexy it hurts
I'm too sexy for my car
Too sexy, you don't even have to go too far
So why don't you come to my house?
I'm too sexy for my hat
