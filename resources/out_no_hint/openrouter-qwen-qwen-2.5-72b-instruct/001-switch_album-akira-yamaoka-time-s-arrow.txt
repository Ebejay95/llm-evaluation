I am the arrow of time
I fly through the air
I am the arrow of time
I pierce the darkness there

I am the arrow of time
I move so fast and far
I am the arrow of time
I leave no room for fear

I am the arrow of time
I never stop or stay
I am the arrow of time
I lead the way each day

I am the arrow of time
I am the force unseen
I am the arrow of time
I am the dream between
