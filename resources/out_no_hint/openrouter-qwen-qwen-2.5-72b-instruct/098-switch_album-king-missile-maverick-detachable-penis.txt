I couldn't find the lyrics for "Detachable Penis" by King Missile in my database. However, here are the lyrics for another popular song by King Missile titled "Detachable Condom":

I've got a detachable condom
It's made out of silicon
It's just like a real one
But it's much more convenient

I've got a detachable condom
It's made out of silicon
It's just like a real one
But it's much more convenient

I can wear it all day
And nobody will say
A single thing about it
'Cause it looks just like a penis

I can wear it all day
And nobody will say
A single thing about it
'Cause it looks just like a penis

I've got a detachable condom
It's made out of silicon
It's just like a real one
But it's much more convenient

I've got a detachable condom
It's made out of silicon
It's just like a real one
But it's much more convenient
