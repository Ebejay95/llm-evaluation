I am the night, I am the dark, I am the fear that hides beneath your skin
I am the silence, I am the scream, I am the shadow that follows you again
I am the nightmare, I am the dream, I am the voice that whispers in your head
I am the hunter, I am the prey, I am the crimson shadows that you cannot shed

I am the night, I am the pain, I am the memory that you cannot erase
I am the fire, I am the rain, I am the storm that rages in your veins
I am the darkness, I am the light, I am the angel with the broken wings
I am the devil, I am the fight, I am the crimson shadows that you cannot bring

I am the night, I am the fear, I am the silence that you cannot hear
I am the shadow, I am the light, I am the crimson shadows that you cannot fight
