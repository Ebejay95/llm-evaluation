In the dark of night, the chickens rise
With glowing eyes, they take to the skies
A poultrygeist, a frightful sight
In the moonlit fields, they dance in flight

Calamari safari, under the sea
Tentacles tangle, a mystery
In the depths below, the hunt begins
A ghostly quest, where the shadows blend

Interlude:
Whispers in the wind, a ghostly tune
Echoes through the night, under the moon
A spectral dance, a haunting scene
Where the living and the dead convene
