I can't see you anymore
I can't see you anymore
I can't see you anymore
I can't see you anymore

I'm in the white room
Where I cannot breathe
I'm in the white room
Where I cannot feel

I can't see you anymore
I can't see you anymore
I can't see you anymore
I can't see you anymore

I'm in the white room
Where I cannot breathe
I'm in the white room
Where I cannot feel

I can't see you anymore
I can't see you anymore
I can't see you anymore
I can't see you anymore

I'm in the white room
Where I cannot breathe
I'm in the white room
Where I cannot feel

I can't see you anymore
I can't see you anymore
I can't see you anymore
I can't see you anymore

I'm in the white room
Where I cannot breathe
I'm in the white room
Where I cannot feel
