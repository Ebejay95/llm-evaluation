Well, I've been down this road before  
But it's different now, I'm not alone anymore  
I got a lot of things to say, a lot of things to share  
Before I go, before I disappear  

I don't want no pity, I don't want no tears  
Just listen to my words, they're all that I have left to give  
I'm just a man, a broken-down machine  
But I got some things to say, before I leave  

I seen the best of times, I seen the worst of times  
I seen the sunshine, I seen the rain  
I done the best I could, but it wasn't good enough  
I paid the price, I wore the chain  

I don't want no pity, I don't want no tears  
Just listen to my words, they're all that I have left to give  
I'm just a man, a broken-down machine  
But I got some things to say, before I leave  

I got a story, it's a long one, it's a true one  
It's about the way we live and the way we die  
I've seen the strong go down, I've seen the weak prevail  
I've seen the world turn upside down, and I've seen it right-side up  

I don't want no pity, I don't want no tears  
Just listen to my words, they're all that I have left to give  
I'm just a man, a broken-down machine  
But I got some things to say, before I leave  

So take these words, they're all I got  
They're the fodder of the soul, they're the stuff you're made of  
I don't want no pity, I don't want no tears  
Just listen to my words, they're all that I have left to give  
I'm just a man, a broken-down machine  
But I got some things to say, before I leave
