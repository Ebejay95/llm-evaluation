In the realm of shadows where silence reigns
Whispers of sorrow in the air remain
A crown of thorns upon my head
Misery's weight, I carry it with dread

Fiction's embrace, a fleeting solace found
In dreams where reality is bound
The night's embrace, a cold, dark shroud
Where echoes of pain, they softly crowd

Lost in the depths of my own despair
A fiction that I cannot tear
The crown of misery, it binds me tight
In the darkness, I lose the light

A story woven from threads of pain
A tale that I cannot contain
The fiction of hope, it fades away
Leaving me to wander in eternal gray

Misery's crown, it weighs so heavy
In the silence, I find no remedy
Fiction's lies, they offer no release
In the darkness, I find no peace
