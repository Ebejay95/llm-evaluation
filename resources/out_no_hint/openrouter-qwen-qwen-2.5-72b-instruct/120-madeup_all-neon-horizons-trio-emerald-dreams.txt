In the heart of the city, the neon lights shine so bright
Dreams of emerald green, in the shadows of the night
Walking down the avenue, where the world is a stage
Every step a story, every face a page

Under the moon's soft glow, the world feels so alive
Whispers of the future, in the air we breathe, we strive
Emerald dreams, they guide us through the storm
A beacon in the chaos, a promise to transform

In the heart of the city, the neon lights never sleep
Emerald dreams, they keep us on our feet
Through the highs and the lows, we find our way
In the neon horizons, we'll make our dreams stay
