Well, I'll pour you a drink, and we'll dance till the dawn
We'll laugh and we'll love, till the cows come home
I'll be your bartender, and you'll be my queen
We'll sip on some moonshine, and pretend we're nineteen

Let's raise a glass to the good times we've had
To the memories that we've made, and the ones that we'll have
We'll bop till we drop, and never look back
In this happy hour, we'll never lack

The jukebox is playin', and the lights are low
We'll twirl and we'll sway, let our troubles go
This happy hour's where we belong
Where the music's loud, and the night is long

So come on, darlin', let's make it a night
We'll dance and we'll dream, everything's alright
We'll bop till we drop, and never say goodbye
In this happy hour, under the hillbilly moon sky
