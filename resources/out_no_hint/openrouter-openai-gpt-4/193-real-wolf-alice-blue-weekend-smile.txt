I ain't afraid though my steps appear tentative
I scope it out then I throw myself into it
I don't need your "protection"
I don't need you to "protect" me
I am formidable when I want to be
I've got spirit and the poetry
I'm not waiting for you to make up your mind
You can't make up your mind

I wear my feelings on my sleeve, you know that
I've been trying to show you that I'm so much more than that
I've been trying to tell you that I won't always be around
I've been trying to tell you something but you don't want to hear me out

I ain't afraid though my steps appear tentative
I scope it out then I throw myself into it
I don't need your "protection"
I don't need you to "protect" me
I am formidable when I want to be
I've got spirit and the poetry
I'm not waiting for you to make up your mind
You can't make up your mind

I wear my feelings on my sleeve, you know that
I've been trying to show you that I'm so much more than that
I've been trying to tell you that I won't always be around
I've been trying to tell you something but you don't want to hear me out
