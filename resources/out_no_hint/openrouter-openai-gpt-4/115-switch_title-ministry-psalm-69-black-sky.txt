Silent foot steps crowed the room
Suicide a bitter doom
Just a matter of time
I'm convinced I don't stand a chance
It's just a matter of time

Tearing solitude
My head cocked sideways
Why argue?
That's all from you
I want peace

Who's first on the last?
Who's on summer?
Who's on fire?
Who's got the powder?
Who's got the gun?

Peeling sunburned skin
Only the lonely
Resisting sleep
I have no defense
I'm looking for you
I'm always looking for you
I'm always looking for you
I'm always looking for you

Who's first on the last?
Who's on summer?
Who's on fire?
Who's got the powder?
Who's got the gun?

It's just a matter of time
Anonymity
I've never been happy
Your voice makes me cringe
Shot glass on the table
Empty chamber, safety off
This is how it feels

Who's first on the last?
Who's on summer?
Who's on fire?
Who's got the powder?
Who's got the gun?

Who's first on the last?
Who's on summer?
Who's on fire?
Who's got the powder?
Who's got the gun?

Silent foot steps crowed the room
Suicide a bitter doom
Just a matter of time
I'm convinced I don't stand a chance
It's just a matter of time
