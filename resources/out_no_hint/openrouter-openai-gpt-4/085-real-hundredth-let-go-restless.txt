I've been restless,
Tossing and turning.
Mind is my mess,
Full of questions.
I've been so faithless,
Lacking in patience,
I need a little bit of rest from
I need a little bit of rest from you.

I've been so restless,
I've been so restless,
I've been so restless,
I've been so restless.

I've been so faithless,
Lacking in patience,
I need a little bit of rest from
I need a little bit of rest from you.

I've been so restless,
I've been so restless,
I've been so restless,
I've been so restless.

I've been so faithless,
Lacking in patience,
I need a little bit of rest from
I need a little bit of rest from you.

I've been so restless,
I've been so restless,
I've been so restless,
I've been so restless.

I've been so faithless,
Lacking in patience,
I need a little bit of rest from
I need a little bit of rest from you.
