I fell out of heaven
To be with you in hell
My sin's not quite seven
Nothing much to tell

Lust I haven't craved
A saintly boy I'm not
I'll take it to my grave
A side eye in every shot

True romance in the dead of the night
I kissed your skull
Is that all right?
True romance in the dead of the night
I kissed your skull
Is that all right?

I fell out of heaven
To be with you in hell
My sin's not quite seven
Nothing much to tell

True romance in the dead of the night
I kissed your skull
Is that all right?
True romance in the dead of the night
I kissed your skull
Is that all right?

True romance in the dead of the night
I kissed your skull
Is that all right?
True romance in the dead of the night
I kissed your skull
Is that all right?
