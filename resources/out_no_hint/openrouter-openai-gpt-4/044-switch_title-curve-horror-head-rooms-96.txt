Dream on, dream on, blame it on your kisser boy
Over time I've come to feel
We've been living in a horror show
Come clean, all you faithless, get in line
You're going to have to step on it, or we're going to start without you
This time, you could be a winner boy, you've lost that bleedin' horror show
It's up to you, you can be anything you want to
