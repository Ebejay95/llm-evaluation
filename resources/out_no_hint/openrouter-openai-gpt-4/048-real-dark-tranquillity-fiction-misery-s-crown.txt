It's a long way to the place where I am now
It's a long, long road and the end is getting near
I've been taken apart, I've been taken down
I've been led astray, I've been led to believe in this

And the crown of misery is not upon me
And the time has come to destroy this
And the crown of misery is not upon me
And the time has come to destroy this

It's a long way to the place where I am now
It's a long, long road and the end is getting near
I've been taken apart, I've been taken down
I've been led astray, I've been led to believe in this

And the crown of misery is not upon me
And the time has come to destroy this
And the crown of misery is not upon me
And the time has come to destroy this

And the crown of misery is not upon me
And the time has come to destroy this
And the crown of misery is not upon me
And the time has come to destroy this

And the crown of misery is not upon me
And the time has come to destroy this
And the crown of misery is not upon me
And the time has come to destroy this.
