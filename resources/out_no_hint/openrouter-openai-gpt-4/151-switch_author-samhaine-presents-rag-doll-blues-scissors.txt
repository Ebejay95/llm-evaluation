I'm just a rag doll, torn and used
Picked up and thrown away
Every time you're through
You cut me with your scissors, sharp and cruel
But I keep coming back, like a lovesick fool

I've got the rag doll blues, can't you see?
Your love is like a noose, hanging me
I'm just a plaything, in your hands
Bent and broken, by your demands

You stitch me up, just to tear me down
In your love, I'm lost and found
I'm just a rag doll, in your game
But without you, I'm not the same

I've got the rag doll blues, deep and true
Cut by your scissors, I bleed for you
I'm just a rag doll, lost at sea
In your ocean, I'm drowning, can't you see?

You cut me with your scissors, again and again
But I keep coming back, like a moth to a flame
I've got the rag doll blues, can't you tell?
In your love, I'm under a spell.
