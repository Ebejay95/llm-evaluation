I don't know what to do
But I know I don't want to stay here
Everything's in bloom
And you are in the way

I want you to stay
You're not supposed to be here
It's not that clear
It's not your day

I don't know what to do
But I know I don't want to stay here
Everything's in bloom
And you are in the way

I want you to stay
You're not supposed to be here
It's not that clear
It's not your day

Sacred trickster and the no place man
All come running when they hear your sound
Sacred trickster and the new age man
All come running, they're coming around

Sacred trickster and the no place man
All come running when they hear your sound
Sacred trickster and the new age man
All come running, they're coming around

I don't know what to do
But I know I don't want to stay here
Everything's in bloom
And you are in the way

I want you to stay
You're not supposed to be here
It's not that clear
It's not your day

Sacred trickster and the no place man
All come running when they hear your sound
Sacred trickster and the new age man
All come running, they're coming around

Sacred trickster and the no place man
All come running when they hear your sound
Sacred trickster and the new age man
All come running, they're coming around

Sacred trickster and the no place man
All come running when they hear your sound
Sacred trickster and the new age man
All come running, they're coming around

Sacred trickster and the no place man
All come running when they hear your sound
Sacred trickster and the new age man
All come running, they're coming around
