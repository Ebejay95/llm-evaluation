In the still of the night, I will be sneakin' 'round your door
In the still of the night, I'll be back for more
In the still of the night, I will be sneakin' 'round your door
In the still of the night, I'll be back for more

I am the night, the day and the light, I am the black and the white
Some days I'm a super bitch, up to my old tricks, but it won't last forever
Next day I'm your super girl, out to save the world, and it keeps getting better

In the still of the night, I will be sneakin' 'round your door
In the still of the night, I'll be back for more
In the still of the night, I will be sneakin' 'round your door
In the still of the night, I'll be back for more

I am the night, the day and the light, I am the black and the white
Some days I'm a super bitch, up to my old tricks, but it won't last forever
Next day I'm your super girl, out to save the world, and it keeps getting better

In the still of the night, I will be sneakin' 'round your door
In the still of the night, I'll be back for more
In the still of the night, I will be sneakin' 'round your door
In the still of the night, I'll be back for more

I am the night, the day and the light, I am the black and the white
Some days I'm a super bitch, up to my old tricks, but it won't last forever
Next day I'm your super girl, out to save the world, and it keeps getting better

In the still of the night, I will be sneakin' 'round your door
In the still of the night, I'll be back for more
In the still of the night, I will be sneakin' 'round your door
In the still of the night, I'll be back for more

I am the night, the day and the light, I am the black and the white
Some days I'm a super bitch, up to my old tricks, but it won't last forever
Next day I'm your super girl, out to save the world, and it keeps getting better.
