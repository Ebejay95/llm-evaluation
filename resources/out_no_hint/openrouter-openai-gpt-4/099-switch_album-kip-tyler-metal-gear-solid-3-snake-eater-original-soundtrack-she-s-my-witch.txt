I've got a woman mean as she can be
Yeah, I've got a woman mean as she can be
Sometimes I think she's almost mean as me

She's got ruby lips and emerald eyes
She's got the moon and stars in her thighs
And every time she loves me, oh, how it satisfies

She's my witch, my witch, my witch, my witch
My witch, my witch, my witch, my witch
She's my witch, hey, hey

She's got a broomstick pony and a black cat bone
She's got a broomstick pony and a black cat bone
And when she's ridin' with me, I'm in the Twilight Zone

She's my witch, my witch, my witch, my witch
My witch, my witch, my witch, my witch
She's my witch, hey, hey

She's got a tombstone hand and a graveyard mind
She's got a tombstone hand and a graveyard mind
Just twenty-one and I don't mind dyin'

She's my witch, my witch, my witch, my witch
My witch, my witch, my witch, my witch
She's my witch, hey, hey

She's got a tombstone hand and a graveyard mind
She's got a tombstone hand and a graveyard mind
Just twenty-one and I don't mind dyin'

She's my witch, my witch, my witch, my witch
My witch, my witch, my witch, my witch
She's my witch, hey, hey

She's my witch, my witch, my witch, my witch
My witch, my witch, my witch, my witch
She's my witch, hey, hey

She's my witch, my witch, my witch, my witch
My witch, my witch, my witch, my witch
She's my witch, hey, hey
