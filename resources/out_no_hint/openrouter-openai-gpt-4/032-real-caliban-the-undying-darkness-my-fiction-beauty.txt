I'm caught in a dream
Sometimes it ain't what it seems
I'm all alone with my fears
I'm screaming out, can't you hear?

I'm caught in a nightmare
I can't escape, I'm trying to wake
I'm all alone with my fears
I'm screaming out, can you hear?

Can you hear my cry?
Can you see my fight?
Can you feel my fear?
I'm all alone, I'm all alone

I'm caught in a dream
Sometimes it ain't what it seems
I'm all alone with my fears
I'm screaming out, can't you hear?

I'm caught in a nightmare
I can't escape, I'm trying to wake
I'm all alone with my fears
I'm screaming out, can you hear?

Can you hear my cry?
Can you see my fight?
Can you feel my fear?
I'm all alone, I'm all alone

I'm caught in a dream
Sometimes it ain't what it seems
I'm all alone with my fears
I'm screaming out, can't you hear?

I'm caught in a nightmare
I can't escape, I'm trying to wake
I'm all alone with my fears
I'm screaming out, can you hear?

Can you hear my cry?
Can you see my fight?
Can you feel my fear?
I'm all alone, I'm all alone

Can you hear my cry?
Can you see my fight?
Can you feel my fear?
I'm all alone, I'm all alone.
