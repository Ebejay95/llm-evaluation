In the lights of waves, I see your face
In the lights of waves, I see your grace
In the lights of waves, I see your trace
In the lights of waves, I see your space

In the lights of waves, I see your glow
In the lights of waves, I see your flow
In the lights of waves, I see your show
In the lights of waves, I see your row

In the lights of waves, I see your beam
In the lights of waves, I see your dream
In the lights of waves, I see your scheme
In the lights of waves, I see your theme

In the lights of waves, I see your shine
In the lights of waves, I see your line
In the lights of waves, I see your sign
In the lights of waves, I see your design

In the lights of waves, I see your light
In the lights of waves, I see your sight
In the lights of waves, I see your fight
In the lights of waves, I see your night

In the lights of waves, I see your day
In the lights of waves, I see your way
In the lights of waves, I see your play
In the lights of waves, I see your stay

In the lights of waves, I see your rise
In the lights of waves, I see your size
In the lights of waves, I see your prize
In the lights of waves, I see your guise

In the lights of waves, I see your fall
In the lights of waves, I see your call
In the lights of waves, I see your wall
In the lights of waves, I see your all

In the lights of waves, I see you
In the lights of waves, I feel you
In the lights of waves, I know you
In the lights of waves, I am you.
