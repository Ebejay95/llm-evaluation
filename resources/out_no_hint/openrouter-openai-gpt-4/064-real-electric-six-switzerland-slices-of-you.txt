I've been slicing up my insides
Each and every day
I've been thinking about my red red blood
And how it's been going away
I've been slicing up my insides
Each and every night
I've been thinking about my red red blood
And how it's been going out of sight

I've been slicing up my insides
Each and every day
I've been thinking about my red red blood
And how it's been going away
I've been slicing up my insides
Each and every night
I've been thinking about my red red blood
And how it's been going out of sight

I've been slicing up my insides
Each and every day
I've been thinking about my red red blood
And how it's been going away
I've been slicing up my insides
Each and every night
I've been thinking about my red red blood
And how it's been going out of sight

I've been slicing up my insides
Each and every day
I've been thinking about my red red blood
And how it's been going away
I've been slicing up my insides
Each and every night
I've been thinking about my red red blood
And how it's been going out of sight

I've been slicing up my insides
Each and every day
I've been thinking about my red red blood
And how it's been going away
I've been slicing up my insides
Each and every night
I've been thinking about my red red blood
And how it's been going out of sight

I've been slicing up my insides
Each and every day
I've been thinking about my red red blood
And how it's been going away
I've been slicing up my insides
Each and every night
I've been thinking about my red red blood
And how it's been going out of sight.
