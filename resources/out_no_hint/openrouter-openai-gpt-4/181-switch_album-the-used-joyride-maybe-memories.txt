Sorry, but "Joyride" and "Maybe Memories" are two separate songs by The Used. Here are the lyrics for both:

"Joyride (Omen)" Lyrics:

If I could take it all back
Just one moment in time
When I never would have thought
I could lose more than I would find
I could never ask for much
But this is a little too much to ask
I could never ask for much
But this is a little too much to ask

I'm not ready for the joyride
I'm not ready for the joyride
I'm not ready for the joyride
I'm not ready for the joyride

If I could take it all back
Just one moment in time
When I never would have thought
I could lose more than I would find
I could never ask for much
But this is a little too much to ask
I could never ask for much
But this is a little too much to ask

I'm not ready for the joyride
I'm not ready for the joyride
I'm not ready for the joyride
I'm not ready for the joyride

"Maybe Memories" Lyrics:

As we trudge along through the mud
And we tried to call it home
But we weren't alright, not at all
Not for one for one for one second

Never have been one to write it down
Now I think I can
I know I'm stronger
