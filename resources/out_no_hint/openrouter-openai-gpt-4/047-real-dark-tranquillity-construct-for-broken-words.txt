In the silence that followed
But your tears felt warm to me
I'm losing your affection
Can't you see
A thousand dreams you're giving up
You never noticed my despair
Memories that we've shared
Are kept in here

As in my
As in my
As in my
As in my
As in my
As in my
As in my
As in my

Poisoned forever by your past
Sorrows that were meant to last
In a world so cold and hollow
Life is there to be denied
Tearing down my will
Unseen the tears in silence
A thousand dreams that we've shared
You and I

As in my
As in my
As in my
As in my
As in my
As in my
As in my
As in my

The silence that we keep
In times of need
And the silence that we keep
From each other, from each other
A thousand dreams you're giving up
Never noticed my despair
Memories that we've shared
Are kept in here

As in my
As in my
As in my
As in my
As in my
As in my
As in my
As in my
