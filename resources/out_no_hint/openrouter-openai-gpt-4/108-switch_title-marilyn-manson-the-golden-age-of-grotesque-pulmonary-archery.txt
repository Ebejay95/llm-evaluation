I'm sorry, but "Pulmonary Archery" is a song by Alexisonfire, not Marilyn Manson. The lyrics to "Pulmonary Archery" are as follows:

If this is the way it's going to be, then I'll call you in the morning
And I'll call you in the evening
And everything will be just fine, fine, fine
If this is the way it's going to be, then I'll call you in the morning
And I'll call you in the evening
And everything will be just fine, fine, fine

And I'm thinking about how you'd whisper something to me
I'm thinking about how you'd whisper something to me
I'm thinking about how you'd whisper something to me
I'm thinking about how you'd whisper something to me

And I'm thinking about how you'd whisper something to me
I'm thinking about how you'd whisper something to me
I'm thinking about how you'd whisper something to me
I'm thinking about how you'd whisper something to me

And I'm thinking about how you'd whisper something to me
I'm thinking about how you'd whisper something to me
I'm thinking about how you'd whisper something to me
I'm thinking about how you'd whisper something to me

And I'm thinking about how you'd whisper something to me
I'm thinking about how you'd whisper something to me
I'm thinking about how you'd whisper something to me
I'm thinking about how you'd whisper something to me

And I'm thinking about how you'd whisper something to me
I'm thinking about how you'd whisper something to me
I'm thinking about how you'd whisper something to me
I'm thinking about how you'd whisper something to me

And I'm thinking about how you'd whisper something to me
I'm thinking about how you'd whisper something to me
I'm thinking about how you'd whisper something to me
