I'm lost in my own head,
There's a war inside myself,
I'm trying to forget,
I'm more than what you see,
I'm painted with black light,
I'm more than what you see,
I'm painted with black light,
I'm more than what you see,
I'm painted with black light,
I'm more than what you see,
I'm painted with black light,
I'm more than what you see,
I'm painted with black light,
I'm more than what you see,
I'm painted with black light,
I'm more than what you see,
I'm painted with black light,
I'm more than what you see,
I'm painted with black light.
