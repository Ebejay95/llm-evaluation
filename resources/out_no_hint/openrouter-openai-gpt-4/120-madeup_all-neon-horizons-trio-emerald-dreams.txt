Emerald dreams, in the neon horizons,
Where the city sleeps, and the night awakens.
In the glow of the lights, where love disguises,
We dance in the shadows of the neon horizons.

Emerald dreams, where the stars are hiding,
In the heart of the night, where our souls are binding.
Under the moonlight, where passion rises,
We find our truth in the neon horizons.

Emerald dreams, in the silent whispers,
Where the secrets lie, in the softest fissures.
In the depth of the night, where time capsizes,
We lose ourselves in the neon horizons.

Emerald dreams, in the neon horizons,
Where the city breathes, and the dawn surprises.
In the break of the light, where hope realizes,
We find our home in the neon horizons.
