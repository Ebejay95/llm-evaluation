Would you like to go there?
I'm not afraid.
I can see you by the fire,
Listen, listen there's something I must confide.
I know I said that it'd be fine,
I know I made it look like it'd be alright.
But I think I learned my lesson,
And I'm not gonna let you out of my sight.

You can call me killer,
'Cause I'll bring you to the light.
And it might taste bitter,
When your answer ain't right.
You can call me killer,
As you look into my eyes,
Nothing but a sinner,
You won't get away this time.
You won't get away this time.
You won't get away this time.
You won't get away.

You won't get away this time.
You won't get away this time.
You won't get away this time.
You won't get away.

I can see you in the morning,
When you go to school.
Don't forget your books,
You know you've got to learn the golden rule.
Don't you remember how it felt,
When you couldn't wait to go outside.
And play all day,
Mother had to come and get you,
At night.

You can call me killer,
'Cause I'll bring you to the light.
And it might taste bitter,
When your answer ain't right.
You can call me killer,
As you look into my eyes,
Nothing but a sinner,
You won't get away this time.
You won't get away this time.
You won't get away this time.
You won't get away.

You won't get away this time.
You won't get away this time.
You won't get away this time.
You won't get away.

You can call me killer,
'Cause I'll bring you to the light.
And it might taste bitter,
When your answer ain't right.
You can call me killer,
As you look into my eyes,
Nothing but a sinner,
You won't get away this time.
You won't get away this time.
You won't get away this time.
You won't get away.

You won't get away this time.
You won't get away this time.
You won't get away this time.
You won't get away.
