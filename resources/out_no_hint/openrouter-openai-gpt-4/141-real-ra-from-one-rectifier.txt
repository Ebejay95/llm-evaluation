I know I hold this loss in me
So long to days of fear and sorrow
And I know I hold the power in me
To create the image of perfection in life

The time has come to recreate existence
And with you I feel the passion and its essence
Now I see the importance of the lesson
Your gift to me is simply my progression

I know I hold the strength in me
To refrain from this sweet surrender
And I know I hold the power in me
To avoid the burning of this slowly dying ember

The time has come to recreate existence
And with you I feel the passion and its essence
Now I see the importance of the lesson
Your gift to me is simply my progression

I know I hold this all in me
The time has come to recreate existence
And with you I feel the passion and its essence
Now I see the importance of the lesson
Your gift to me is simply my progression

The time has come to recreate existence
And with you I feel the passion and its essence
Now I see the importance of the lesson
Your gift to me is simply my progression
