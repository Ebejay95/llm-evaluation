I don't understand why the world's so confusing
I don't understand why it's so hard to find answers
I don't understand why I'm constantly losing
I don't understand why I'm a human disaster

I don't understand why I'm always complaining
I don't understand why I'm always in pain
I don't understand why I'm always explaining
I don't understand why I'm always to blame

I don't understand why I'm always alone
I don't understand why I'm not in a band
I don't understand why I'm not fully grown
I don't understand why I don't understand

I don't understand why I'm always crying
I don't understand why I'm always lying
I don't understand why I'm always trying
I don't understand why I'm always dying

I don't understand why I'm always alone
I don't understand why I'm not in a band
I don't understand why I'm not fully grown
I don't understand why I don't understand

I don't understand why I'm always alone
I don't understand why I'm not in a band
I don't understand why I'm not fully grown
I don't understand why I don't understand

I don't understand why I don't understand
I don't understand why I don't understand
I don't understand why I don't understand
I don't understand why I don't understand
