I thought I was alive but I was just surviving
Until I found a strength within, not relying on myself
My heart is filled with power that I never knew existed
And I won't be the same again

Now I've seen a different light, the dawn of a new day
And my spirit has been reborn
I am not afraid, I will not be silenced
This is my time, I will rise above

I will not be silenced, I will not be silenced
I will not be silenced, I will not be silenced

I thought I was alive but I was just surviving
Until I found a strength within, not relying on myself
My heart is filled with power that I never knew existed
And I won't be the same again

Now I've seen a different light, the dawn of a new day
And my spirit has been reborn
I am not afraid, I will not be silenced
This is my time, I will rise above

I will not be silenced, I will not be silenced
I will not be silenced, I will not be silenced

I will not be silenced, I will not be silenced
I will not be silenced, I will not be silenced
I will not be silenced, I will not be silenced
I will not be silenced, I will not be silenced
