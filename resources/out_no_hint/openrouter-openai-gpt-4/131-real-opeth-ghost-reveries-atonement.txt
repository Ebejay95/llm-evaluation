Cleared the fog that was veiling my eyes
Bare, wrested the right to the throne
Inheritance of a day lost
The beauty of the dead, we've always been

Endlessly, we met in the garden
Held on so close, we fell into the sky
Mended the rift that had kept us apart
For eternity, we will haunt

The scent of the elder flowers
Their fragrance seeping into my skin
A flicker of the candlelight
An olden craft, seeped in sin

Cleared the fog that was veiling my eyes
Bare, wrested the right to the throne
Inheritance of a day lost
The beauty of the dead, we've always been

Endlessly, we met in the garden
Held on so close, we fell into the sky
Mended the rift that had kept us apart
For eternity, we will haunt

The scent of the elder flowers
Their fragrance seeping into my skin
A flicker of the candlelight
An olden craft, seeped in sin

Cleared the fog that was veiling my eyes
Bare, wrested the right to the throne
Inheritance of a day lost
The beauty of the dead, we've always been

Endlessly, we met in the garden
Held on so close, we fell into the sky
Mended the rift that had kept us apart
For eternity, we will haunt

The scent of the elder flowers
Their fragrance seeping into my skin
A flicker of the candlelight
An olden craft, seeped in sin

Cleared the fog that was veiling my eyes
Bare, wrested the right to the throne
Inheritance of a day lost
The beauty of the dead, we've always been

Endlessly, we met in the garden
Held on so close, we fell into the sky
Mended the rift that had kept us apart
For eternity, we will haunt

The scent of the elder flowers
Their fragrance seeping into my skin
A flicker of the candlelight
An olden craft, seeped in sin

Cleared the fog that was veiling my eyes
Bare, wrested the right to the throne
Inheritance of a day lost
The beauty of the dead, we've always been

Endlessly, we met in the garden
Held on so close, we fell into the sky
Mended the rift that had kept us apart
For eternity, we will haunt

The scent of the elder flowers
Their fragrance seeping into my skin
A flicker of the candlelight
An olden craft, seeped in sin

Cleared the fog that was veiling my eyes
