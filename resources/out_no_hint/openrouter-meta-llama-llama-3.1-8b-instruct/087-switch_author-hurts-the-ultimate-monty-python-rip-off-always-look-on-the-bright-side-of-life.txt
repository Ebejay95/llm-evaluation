Always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the bright side of life

When you're short of time
When you're waiting for the sky to fall
Always look on the bright side of life

When a crocodile dines on a fly
When a crocodile dines on a fly
Always look on the bright side of life

When a man lies on a gurney of pain
Always look on the bright side of life

Always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the bright side of life

When you're short of time
When you're waiting for the sky to fall
Always look on the bright side of life

When a man is dying
Always look on the bright side of life

Always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the bright side of life
