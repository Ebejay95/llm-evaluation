You're a fan of the 90s Britpop scene!

Here are the lyrics:

"Horror head, horror head
You're a horror head
You're a horror head
You're a horror head
You're a horror head
You're a horror head
You're a horror head
You're a horror head
You're a horror head"

"Rooms #96, rooms #96
I'm in rooms #96
I'm in rooms #96
I'm in rooms #96
I'm in rooms #96"
