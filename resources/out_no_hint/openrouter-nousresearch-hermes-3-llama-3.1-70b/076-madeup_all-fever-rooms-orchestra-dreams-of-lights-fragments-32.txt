In the depths of slumber, visions take flight
Fragments of dreams, dancing in the night
Whispers of melodies, a symphony untold
The Fever Rooms Orchestra, a story to unfold

Dreams of Lights, a kaleidoscope of sound
Shimmering notes, in fragments profound
A tapestry woven, of memories and time
Each stitch a story, a rhythm sublime

In the quiet moments, between waking and sleep
The orchestra plays, a lullaby so deep
Guiding the listener, through realms of thought
Where dreams and reality, are intricately wrought

Fragments #32, a piece of the whole
A glimpse into the mind, a window to the soul
The Fever Rooms Orchestra, a nameless creation
Dreams of Lights, an ethereal sensation

In the stillness of the night, the music takes hold
A journey through the psyche, a story to be told
Fragments of dreams, like puzzle pieces scattered
The Fever Rooms Orchestra, a mosaic so mattered

So close your eyes, and let the symphony begin
Dreams of Lights, where the magic lies within
Fragments #32, a key to unlock the door
To the Fever Rooms Orchestra, forevermore
