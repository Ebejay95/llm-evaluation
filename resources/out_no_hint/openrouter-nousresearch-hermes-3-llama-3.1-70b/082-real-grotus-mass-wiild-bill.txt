Here are the lyrics for the song "Mass" by Grotus, featuring Wild Bill:

Mass
Grotus featuring Wild Bill

Verse 1:
The congregation gathers 'round
To hear the words of the man
Who claims to know the way
To the promised land

Chorus:
Mass, it's just a mass
Of people lost and found
Mass, it's just a mass
Of souls that can't be bound

Verse 2: 
The preacher speaks in tongues
Of fire and brimstone
He says the end is near
And we must all atone

(Chorus)

Bridge:
But I don't believe in heaven
I don't believe in hell
I believe in living
And the stories that we tell

(Chorus)

Outro:
Mass, it's just a mass
Of people lost and found
Mass, it's just a mass
Of souls that can't be bound
