Here is the lyrics text for the song "Paper Skylines" by Golden Rooms Trio, from their album Lights #66:

Verse 1:
City lights, they shine so bright
Casting shadows, stretching far and wide
Paper skylines, a symphony of sights
A lullaby, a soothing balm tonight

Chorus:
In the stillness, in the quiet
I find my peace, my heart's delight
Golden hues, a gentle glow
Guiding me, where I need to go

Verse 2: 
Winding roads, a journey unfolds
Stories written, in the city's hold
Paper skylines, a tapestry of dreams
A canvas painted, with hopes and schemes

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:
In the twilight, in the dawn
I'm drawn to you, my love is sworn
Golden Rooms Trio, our hearts entwine
In paper skylines, forever mine

(Repeat Chorus)

Outro:
City lights, they shine so bright
Paper skylines, until the morning light
