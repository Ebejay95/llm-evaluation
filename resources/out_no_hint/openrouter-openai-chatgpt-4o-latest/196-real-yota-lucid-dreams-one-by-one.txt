One by one  
We fall into the dark  
As we run  
We forget who we are  
Holding on  
To the pieces of our hearts  
One by one  
We fall into the dark  

Time goes by  
Like a thief in the night  
Close your eyes  
And it all passes by  
In your mind  
You can leave it all behind  
Time goes by  
Like a thief in the night  

One by one  
We fall into the dark  
As we run  
We forget who we are  
Holding on  
To the pieces of our hearts  
One by one  
We fall into the dark
