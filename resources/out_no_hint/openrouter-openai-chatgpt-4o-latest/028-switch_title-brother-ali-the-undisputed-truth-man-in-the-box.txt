I was born with the soul of a man in the box  
My folks decided that's the man that I got  
Now I'm standin' here sayin' man, I can't stop  
Man, I can't breathe, but I man up, you see  
Now I got a little man of my own to raise  
Teach him the ways, mold him and shape  
Holdin' his face in my hands so he knows  
That he safe and he grows to be great  
But I know that he won't if I don't escape  
From this box that they keep us in  
'Cause it ain't just me, it's us, we stuck  
In a box that they keep us in  
Listen, I don't have a problem with tough  
I'm just tryin' to redefine what a man is  
If you fightin' to be the boss  
So you lift weights or you buy big guns  
That's just as small as it gets  
You ain't hard, you just angry and scared  
Tryin' to cover up for it, but that's not man  
That's not standin' up, that's not love  
That's not wisdom, that's not strength  
That's not courage, that's not king  
That's not power, that's not change  
That's not savin' your family  
That's not God, man, that's insane  
That's a sucker you ain't gotta be  
I can be anything I wanna be  
Forget the box, I'ma break the mold  
I'ma take control and own it  
I'ma shape it, mold it, break it open  
I'ma make it known, I ain't alone  
I'ma face my fears and embrace my flaws  
I'ma take what's mine and reclaim my cause  
I'ma stand up tall in the face of odds  
I'ma be that man that was made by God
