Crimson shadows, spreading their wings  
Silent as whispers, darkness it brings  
Creeping and crawling, slithering near  
Feeding on anger, breeding on fear  

Eyes in the distance, glowing with hate  
Twisting your fate, it's already too late  
Cold winds are howling, calling your name  
Dragging you down to the heart of the flame  

Crimson shadows, dancing with death  
Stealing your soul with every breath  
No use in running, nowhere to hide  
The shadows will find you, and pull you inside
