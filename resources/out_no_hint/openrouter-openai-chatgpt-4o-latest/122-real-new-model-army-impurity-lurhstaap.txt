He came to me in the morning  
And he smiled  
He seemed to me like a man who could be free  
And we laughed  
And we talked  
And we drank  
And we joked  
And we smoked  
And we laughed  
And we talked  
And we drank  
And we joked  
And we smoked  
And he told me his name  

He said, "Now you can call me Lurhstaap  
I have come to bring you pain  
I have come to bring you terror  
I have come to take your gain  
I have come to bring you torment  
I have come to steal your pride  
I have come to steal your soul  
I have come to steal your mind"  

He said, "Now you can call me Lurhstaap  
I have come to bring you pain  
I have come to bring you terror  
I have come to take your gain  
I have come to bring you torment  
I have come to steal your pride  
I have come to steal your soul  
I have come to steal your mind"  

And he laughed  
And he laughed  
And he laughed  
And he laughed  
And he laughed  
And he laughed  
And he laughed  
And he laughed  
And he laughed  
And he laughed  
And he laughed  
And he laughed  
And he laughed  
And he laughed  
And he laughed  
And he laughed
