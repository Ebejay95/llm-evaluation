I'm in love, it's a sunny day  
But it's raining in my heart  
I know it's love that's got me this way  
But I don't know where to start  

And I don't want to need you  
'Cause I can't have you anymore  
You're not mine  

I don't want to see you  
'Cause your face reminds me  
Of the time when we were fine  

You were always number one  
But now you're just no. 4  
And I don't want you anymore  

I remember when we used to laugh  
About nothing at all  
It was better than going mad  
From trying to solve all the problems  

We're not supposed to understand  
But I don't want to need you  
'Cause I can't have you anymore  
You're not mine  

I don't want to see you  
'Cause your face reminds me  
Of the time when we were fine  

You were always number one  
But now you're just no. 4  
And I don't want you anymore  

You were always number one  
But now you're just no. 4  
And I don't want you anymore
