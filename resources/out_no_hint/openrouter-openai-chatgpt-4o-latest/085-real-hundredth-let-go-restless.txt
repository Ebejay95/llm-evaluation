Let go  
Let go  
Let go  
Let go  

Restless  
I am so restless  
And I’m not sure what it is  
That’s eating at my soul  
I feel so weightless  
So disconnected  
But somehow I still know  
Where I need to go  

Let go  
Let go  
Let go  
Let go  

I’ve been holding on so tight  
To things that only hold me back  
I’ve been chasing all the wrong things  
Trying to fill this emptiness  

Let go  
Let go  
Let go  
Let go  

Restless  
I am so restless  
But I know I can’t stay here  
I’ve got to move, I’ve got to change  
I’ve got to face my fear  

Let go  
Let go  
Let go  
Let go
