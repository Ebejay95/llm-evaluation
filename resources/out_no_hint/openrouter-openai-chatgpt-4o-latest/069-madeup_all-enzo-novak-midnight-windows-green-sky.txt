Midnight windows, city glows  
Neon rivers where silence flows  
Green sky hanging over me  
Dreams drift in electric sea  

Footsteps echo down the lane  
Heartbeats sync with falling rain  
Shadows dance in static light  
Chasing ghosts into the night  

Green sky, take me far from here  
Through the noise I disappear  
Midnight windows, open wide  
Let me slip into the tide  

Flicker signs and whispered calls  
Lonely towers, concrete walls  
Still I wander, still I try  
To find the truth beneath the sky  

Green sky, take me far from here  
Through the noise I disappear  
Midnight windows, open wide  
Let me slip into the tide
