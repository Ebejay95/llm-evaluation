In the stillness of the neon night  
Whispers echo in electric light  
Chasing echoes through the streams  
We drift inside aurora dreams  

Flickers dance on mirrored skies  
Code and stardust in our eyes  
Through the silence, through the beams  
We float within aurora dreams  

Binary hearts begin to glow  
In rhythms only we could know  
Time dissolves in silver seams  
Weâ€™re lost inside aurora dreams  

No more borders, no more names  
Only pulses, only flames  
In this place of endless themes  
We live within aurora dreams
