Cut the vibe, don't let it ride  
Feel the tension deep inside  
Lights go low, the silence loud  
Lost in rhythm, lost in crowd  

Shadows move, the beat is tight  
Midnight calls, we own the night  
Pulse is racing, can't decide  
If I should run or just collide  

Cut the vibe, it's getting cold  
Stories whispered, never told  
Eyes that flicker, truth or lie  
In this moment, we just try  

Cut the vibe, don't let it stay  
Let it drift and fade away  
No more echoes, no more signs  
Just the silence we designed
