I see your eyes  
They’re looking for trouble  
I feel your hands  
They’re pulling me under  
I hear your voice  
It’s calling me over  
I know your game  
You’re playing it colder  

You wanna tame me  
But I’m not that easy  
You wanna break me  
But I’m not that weak  
You wanna change me  
But I’m not that type  
You wanna tame me  
But I won’t comply  

I feel your breath  
It’s burning my shoulder  
I see your smile  
It’s getting me closer  
I hear your lies  
They’re sweet like sugar  
I know your kind  
You’re just a hunter  

You wanna tame me  
But I’m not that easy  
You wanna break me  
But I’m not that weak  
You wanna change me  
But I’m not that type  
You wanna tame me  
But I won’t comply
