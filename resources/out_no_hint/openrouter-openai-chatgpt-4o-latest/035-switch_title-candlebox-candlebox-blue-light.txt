I see the blue light  
I see it shining down on me  
I see the blue light  
I see it coming over me  
Shining so bright  
Shining right into my eyes  
Don't you know it makes me feel  
Like I wanna cry  

I see the blue light  
I see it washing over me  
I see the blue light  
I see it taking over me  
Shining so bright  
Shining right into my mind  
Don't you know it makes me feel  
Like I wanna die  

Blue light  
Blue light  
Blue light  
Blue light  

I see the blue light  
I see it shining down on me  
I see the blue light  
I see it coming over me  
Shining so bright  
Shining right into my eyes  
Don't you know it makes me feel  
Like I wanna cry  

Blue light  
Blue light  
Blue light  
Blue light
