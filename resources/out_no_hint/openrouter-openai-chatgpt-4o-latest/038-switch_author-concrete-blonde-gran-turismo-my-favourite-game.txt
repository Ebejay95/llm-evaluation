I was right and you were wrong  
Been telling myself this for so long  
So long  

I'm sorry, I forgot your name  
You're my favourite game  

And all our friends  
They come around  
Always looking for a ride  
But I don't mind  
I play the clown  
While you take your time  

I was right and you were wrong  
Been telling myself this for so long  
So long  

I'm sorry, I forgot your name  
You're my favourite game  

You're my favourite game  
You're my favourite game  
You're my favourite game
