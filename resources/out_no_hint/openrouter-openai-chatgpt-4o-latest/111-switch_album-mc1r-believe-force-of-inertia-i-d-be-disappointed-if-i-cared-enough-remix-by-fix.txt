Believe in nothing,  
Feel the weight,  
Force of inertia,  
Pulling me straight.  

I’d be disappointed,  
If I cared enough,  
But apathy’s comfort  
Is cold and rough.  

Signals fading,  
Truths collide,  
In the static silence  
Where doubts reside.  

Believe in nothing,  
Let it go,  
The force within  
Is all I know.
