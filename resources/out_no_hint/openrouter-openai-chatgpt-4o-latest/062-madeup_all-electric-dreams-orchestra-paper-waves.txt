Drift on paper waves tonight  
Folded thoughts in silent flight  
Ink runs deep where secrets lie  
Underneath a twilight sky  

Whispers float on ocean air  
Memories drawn with tender care  
Currents pull the past away  
But shadows of you always stay  

Sailing through electric streams  
Lost inside our paper dreams  
Every fold a tale untold  
In your hands, my heart you hold  

Crashing soft on distant shores  
Echoes of the love that soars  
Though the tide may turn and fade  
Paper waves will never break
