Memory flow  
Electric dreams  
Synthetic thoughts  
Burst at the seams  

Neon pulses  
Through my mind  
Fragments lost  
In data blind  

Circuit whispers  
Echo deep  
In coded silence  
I cannot sleep  

Memory flow  
A glitch, a spark  
Fading traces  
In the dark  

Upload feelings  
Download pain  
Looping shadows  
Once again  

Memory flow  
Erase, rewind  
What was real  
Now undefined
