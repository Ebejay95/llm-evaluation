Herefore, herefore, we stand in line  
Waiting for the sun to shine  
Echoes of a distant drum  
Calling us to where we're from  

Herefore, herefore, the time is near  
Whispers only we can hear  
Footsteps on a broken road  
Carrying a heavy load  

Herefore, herefore, hearts ignite  
Burning through the longest night  
Shadows fall but we remain  
Dancing in the pouring rain  

Herefore, herefore, we belong  
In the silence and the song  
Bound by more than blood or name  
Kindled by a common flame
