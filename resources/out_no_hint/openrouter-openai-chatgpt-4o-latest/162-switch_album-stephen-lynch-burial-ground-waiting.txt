I'm waiting in the burial ground  
For you to come around  
I'm waiting in the burial ground  
For you to come around  

The moon is high, the night is still  
I feel a chill  
The trees all whisper your name  
But you never came  

I'm waiting in the burial ground  
For you to come around  
I'm waiting in the burial ground  
For you to come around  

The flowers died, the stone is cracked  
You can't come back  
But still I sit and wait  
At this iron gate  

I'm waiting in the burial ground  
For you to come around  
I'm waiting in the burial ground  
For you to come around
