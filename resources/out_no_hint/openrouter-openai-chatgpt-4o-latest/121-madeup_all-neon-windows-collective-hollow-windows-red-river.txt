Hollow windows, red river flows  
Through the silence where no one goes  
Neon flickers in the midnight rain  
Echoes dancing on a ghostly train  

Shadows lean on the alley walls  
Footsteps vanish when the darkness calls  
Crimson stories in the glass refract  
Truth and memory never interact  

Flickering signs in a sleepless town  
Dreams like ashes falling down  
Hollow windows, watching still  
Red river winding past the hill  

No voices left to fill the air  
Only the hum of electric prayer  
Neon windows, hollow light  
Bleeding color into the night
