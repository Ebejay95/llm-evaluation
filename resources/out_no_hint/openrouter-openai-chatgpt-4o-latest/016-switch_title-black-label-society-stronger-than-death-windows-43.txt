Take a look through my window  
Tell me what do you see  
Why you're so afraid  
Of the other side  
It's just a different me  

But you won't listen  
You won't stand up  
You won't even try  
You just keep sittin'  
With your head in your hands  
And maybe you'll cry  

So take a look through your window  
Tell me what do you see  
Why you're so afraid  
Of the other side  
It's just a different me  

But you won't listen  
You won't stand up  
You won't even try  
You just keep sittin'  
With your head in your hands  
And maybe you'll cry  

Take a look through my window  
Tell me what do you see  
Why you're so afraid  
Of the other side  
It's just a different me
