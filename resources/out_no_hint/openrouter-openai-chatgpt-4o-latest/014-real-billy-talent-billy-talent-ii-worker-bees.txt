Turn your back, you're a broken man  
Come around and you'll understand  
What's inside of me  
You'll despise 'cause I'm there to see  

Take a look at what I've done  
Nothing left, just a smoking gun  
What's inside of me  
You'll despise 'cause I'm there to see  

Worker bees can leave  
Even drones can fly away  
The queen is their slave  

Worker bees can leave  
Even drones can fly away  
The queen is their slave  

Yeah  

I pull my heart onto my sleeve  
I'm not afraid  
To say what I mean  
Mean what I say  
Set myself up  
And let myself down  
I tried so hard  
But I can't even drown  

Worker bees can leave  
Even drones can fly away  
The queen is their slave  

Worker bees can leave  
Even drones can fly away  
The queen is their slave  

Yeah  

Worker bees can leave  
Even drones can fly away  
The queen is their slave  

Worker bees can leave  
Even drones can fly away  
The queen is their slave  

Yeah
