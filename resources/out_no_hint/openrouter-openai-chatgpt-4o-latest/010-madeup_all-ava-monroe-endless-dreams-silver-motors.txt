Endless roads and silver skies  
Chasing light where freedom lies  
Engines hum a lullaby  
In your arms, I learn to fly  

Neon signs and midnight beams  
We ride through our endless dreams  
No map, no plan, just you and me  
Lost in love, eternally  

Highways stretch like memories  
Fading towns and autumn leaves  
Your voice cuts through the radio  
A song I never want to go  

Endless dreams in silver cars  
Weâ€™re burning time beneath the stars  
No destination, just the ride  
With you forever by my side
