Crushed velvet drapes the sky  
As I fall into your eyes  
Electric pulses in my veins  
Can't escape these binding chains  

Whispers echo in my mind  
Fragments of a life behind  
Torn between the now and then  
Will I ever feel again?  

Crushed beneath the weight of time  
Moments lost I thought were mine  
Shadows stretch across the floor  
I don't know me anymore  

Flickers of a distant flame  
Calling out a broken name  
Every breath a silent scream  
Caught inside a dying dream  

Crushed beneath the weight of time  
Moments lost I thought were mine  
Shadows stretch across the floor  
I don't know me anymore
