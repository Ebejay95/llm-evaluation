Black and white  
I see your face in black and white  
I try to chase the colored light  
But all I find is black and white  

Hold me close  
But not too tight, I might explode  
I'm fragile in this heavy load  
Still searching for a place called home  

You speak in tones  
That echo through my hollow bones  
A language that I've never known  
But still I feel it in my soul  

Black and white  
The world around me lost its light  
I reach for you to make it right  
But all I touch is black and white
