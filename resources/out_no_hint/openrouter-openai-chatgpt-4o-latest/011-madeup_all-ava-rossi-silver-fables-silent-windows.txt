Silent windows watch the rain  
Echoes soft on midnight pane  
Silver fables in the air  
Whispers drift, but no one's there  

Shadows stretch across the floor  
Memories locked behind the door  
Flickers dance on candlelight  
Truths concealed in velvet night  

Footsteps lost in distant time  
Chimes that ring without a rhyme  
Silent windows, still they see  
All the ghosts we used to be
