Time, it don't wait for you  
Slips through like sand in your shoes  
Hold on, it's all you can do  
Hourglass, running out too soon  

Ashes of the wake we tread  
Words we never should have said  
Echoes ringing in my head  
Can't forget, can't pretend  

Falling through the cracks of days  
Moments lost in a smoky haze  
Try to hold, but it slips away  
Hourglass, won't let me stay  

Ashes of the wake we tread  
Words we never should have said  
Echoes ringing in my head  
Can't forget, can't pretend  

Time, it don't wait for you  
Slips through like sand in your shoes  
Hold on, it's all you can do  
Hourglass, running out too soon
