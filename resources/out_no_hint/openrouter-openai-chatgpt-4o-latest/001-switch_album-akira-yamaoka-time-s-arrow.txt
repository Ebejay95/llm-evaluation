The clock is ticking  
Time passes by  
Moments dissolve  
Like tears in the sky  

Shadows are falling  
Night's drawing near  
Whispers of silence  
Only I hear  

Time's arrow flying  
Straight through my soul  
No way to stop it  
No way to hold  

Memories flicker  
Like film on a reel  
Fading and fleeting  
Too distant to feel  

The past is behind me  
The future's unknown  
I'm caught in the middle  
Drifting alone  

Time's arrow flying  
Straight through my soul  
No way to stop it  
No way to hold
