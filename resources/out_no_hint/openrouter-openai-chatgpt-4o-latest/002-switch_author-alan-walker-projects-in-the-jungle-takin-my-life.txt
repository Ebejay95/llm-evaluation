Takin' my life, I'm takin' my time  
Through valleys of shadows, I’m crossing the line  
No turning back, the past in the dust  
I’m chasing the fire, in dreams that I trust  

Voices behind me, they whisper and fade  
But I keep on walking, I’m not afraid  
Storms in my chest, but calm in my eyes  
I’m reaching for truth beneath all the lies  

Takin' my life, not wasting a breath  
I’m dancing with fate, I’m flirting with death  
Every heartbeat a step on the wire  
Fueling my soul, igniting desire  

No chains can hold me, no fear can bind  
I’ve broken the silence, I’ve made up my mind  
Takin' my life, it’s mine to define  
A journey of one, a mountain to climb
