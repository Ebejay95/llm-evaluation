Endless gardens in my mind  
Skylines blur, we leave behind  
Whispers float on winds so high  
Fading echoes in the sky  

Steps we took on silent stone  
Paths that led us far from home  
Petals fall in twilightâ€™s glow  
Time dissolves in undertow  

Chasing light through silver haze  
Moments lost in endless maze  
Still we reach with open hands  
For dreams like shifting desert sands  

Endless gardens, still they bloom  
In the quiet, past the gloom  
Skylines fade, but hearts remain  
Echoes calling through the rain
