In this terminal  
I sleep alone  
I wait for you  
To come back home  

A quiet place  
An empty bed  
All the things  
We left unsaid  

I feel your touch  
Across the wires  
A distant voice  
That never tires  

In this terminal  
I fade away  
Another night  
Another day  

I see your face  
Behind the glass  
A fleeting dream  
That will not last  

In this terminal  
I sleep alone  
I wait for you  
To come back home
