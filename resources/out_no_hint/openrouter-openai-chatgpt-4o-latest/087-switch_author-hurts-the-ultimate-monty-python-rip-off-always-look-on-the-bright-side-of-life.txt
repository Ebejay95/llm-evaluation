Always look on the bright side of life  
Always look on the light side of life  

If life seems jolly rotten  
There's something you've forgotten  
And that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing  

When you're feeling in the dumps  
Don't be silly chumps  
Just purse your lips and whistle, that's the thing  

And always look on the bright side of life  
Always look on the right side of life  

For life is quite absurd  
And death's the final word  
You must always face the curtain with a bow  

Forget about your sin  
Give the audience a grin  
Enjoy it, it's your last chance anyhow  

So always look on the bright side of death  
Just before you draw your terminal breath  

Life's a piece of shit  
When you look at it  
Life's a laugh and death's a joke, it's true  

You'll see it's all a show  
Keep 'em laughing as you go  
Just remember that the last laugh is on you  

And always look on the bright side of life  
Always look on the right side of life  
Always look on the bright side of life  
Always look on the bright side of life
