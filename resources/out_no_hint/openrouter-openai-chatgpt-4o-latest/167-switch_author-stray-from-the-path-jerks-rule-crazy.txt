Jerks rule, jerks rule  
They got the money and the power and they won't play cool  
Jerks rule, jerks rule  
They got the suits and the ties and they act like fools  

Crazy, crazy, it's a crazy world  
Where the bad guys win and the good get hurled  
Crazy, crazy, it's a crazy game  
Where the ones at the top got no shame  

Jerks rule, jerks rule  
They make the laws and they bend every rule  
Jerks rule, jerks rule  
They laugh at us while they swim in their pool  

Crazy, crazy, it's a crazy ride  
Where the truth gets lost and the lies won't hide  
Crazy, crazy, it's a crazy scene  
Where the meanest ones get to live the dream  

Jerks rule, jerks rule  
They got the stage and they act so cruel  
Jerks rule, jerks rule  
But we won't bow down, we won't be their tool
