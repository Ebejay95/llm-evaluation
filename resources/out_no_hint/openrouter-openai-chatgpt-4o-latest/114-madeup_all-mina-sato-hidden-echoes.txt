Whispers in the hallway, shadows on the wall  
Footsteps in the silence, I hear them call  
Flickers in the mirror, faces I once knew  
Echoes of a memory, fading into blue  

Hidden echoes, calling out my name  
In the quiet corners, nothing feels the same  
Time slips through the window, dust upon the floor  
I chase the voice of something I can't ignore  

Letters left unopened, dreams I never read  
Moments lost in stillness, words I never said  
The past is like a lantern, swinging in the dark  
Guiding me through questions, leaving just a spark  

Hidden echoes, calling out my name  
In the quiet corners, nothing feels the same  
Time slips through the window, dust upon the floor  
I chase the voice of something I can't ignore  

Breath upon the curtain, wind without a breeze  
Truth behind the silence, begging me to see  
Every step I follow, deeper in the maze  
Haunted by the silence of forgotten days  

Hidden echoes, calling out my name  
In the quiet corners, nothing feels the same  
Time slips through the window, dust upon the floor  
I chase the voice of something I can't ignore
