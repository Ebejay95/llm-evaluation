Oleander in the summer  
Blowing through the jasmine light  
You and I on a joyride  
Spinning through the fountain night  

Fountain and Vine, we were golden  
Running where the streets align  
Every shadow softly folding  
Into dreams we left behind  

Oleander, sweet and bitter  
Blooming where the heart wonâ€™t lie  
You and I on a joyride  
Chasing down the endless sky
