Yeht mae, eam they  
Whispers in the dawn  
Aurora scenes replay  
Where shadows have withdrawn  

Eam they, yeht mae  
In silence we remain  
Colors melt away  
But memories sustain  

Aurora scenes arise  
In the corners of our mind  
Time bends and flies  
Yet still, we try to find  

Yeht mae, eam they  
Reflections in the stream  
Flickers of the day  
That vanish like a dream
