I know the pain that lies behind your stare  
I know the path that brought you there  
It was a place of hopelessness  
Now you’re fighting just to breathe  

I know the feeling of being too weak to stand  
And the feeling of shame  
That you may never rise again  

But you will rise again  
And you will be stronger  
Stronger than you’ve ever been  

Whispering silence  
Tells me everything  
Whispering silence  
Tells me everything  

I know the pain that lies behind your stare  
I know the path that brought you there  
It was a place of hopelessness  
Now you’re fighting just to breathe  

But you will rise again  
And you will be stronger  
Stronger than you’ve ever been  

Whispering silence  
Tells me everything  
Whispering silence  
Tells me everything  

You will rise again  
You will rise again  
You will rise again  
You will rise again
