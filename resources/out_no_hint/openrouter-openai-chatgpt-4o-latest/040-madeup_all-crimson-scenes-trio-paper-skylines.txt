Paper skylines fold and fall,  
Drifting past the bedroom wall  
Crimson scenes in silent flight  
Paint the corners of the night  

Shadows stretch in paper towns  
Echoes lost in quiet sounds  
Windows flicker, soft and wide  
Dreams escape where fears reside  

Ink runs dry on whispered lines  
Tracing paths through tangled minds  
Folded hopes in fragile hands  
Float above forgotten lands  

Paper skylines, torn and bent  
Hold the weight of what we meant  
Crimson scenes begin to fade  
With the light we never made
