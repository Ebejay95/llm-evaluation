Lights flicker in the silence,  
Shadows dance across the wall,  
Binary dreams in defiance,  
Echoes in the data hall.  

Neon pulses through the wires,  
Circuits hum a lullaby,  
Ghosts of code and old desires,  
Drift beneath a cobalt sky.  

Reflections in the glass divide,  
Truth and fiction intertwine,  
In the dark, we learn to hide,  
Patterns lost in tangled lines.  

Lights of shadows, ever turning,  
Fading fast, forever burning,  
In this maze of thought and steel,  
Only silence left to feel.
