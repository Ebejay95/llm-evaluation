Silver lights club, wandering rooms  
Echoes of footsteps, forgotten tunes  
Neon reflections in puddles below  
Flickering signs where the lost ones go  

Signals are crossing, number fourteen  
Messages hidden in spaces between  
Shadows are dancing on ceilings above  
Caught in the static of unspoken love  

Mirrors remember the faces theyâ€™ve seen  
Moments suspended in lavender sheen  
Time slips sideways, caught in a loop  
Silver lights flicker, truth in a swoop  

Wandering rooms with no end in sight  
Doors that appear only at night  
Signals keep pulsing, calling me near  
To the place where silence is all I hear
