I watched the sky as it fell around me  
Saw the days turn to nights  
And the back again  
And all that time  
I was afraid  
I was afraid to let you in  

To let you see  
My blackened heart  
I never thought  
That I could love  
But you brought this heart to life  
And now I know  
I know I’ll never be the same  

I watched the sky as it fell around me

To let you see  
My blackened heart  
I never thought  
That I could love  
But you brought this heart to life  
And now I know  
I know I’ll never be the same
