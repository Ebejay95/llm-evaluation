I’ve been running my whole life  
And now I’ve got nowhere else to go  
The only thing that matters  
Is the one thing I can’t find  
But I’m not giving up  
No, I’m not giving in  
I will not let this end  
Before it begins  

White light, take me home  
I’m surrounded but I’m not alone  
White light, guide me through  
I’ll follow you  

I’ve been searching for the answers  
To the questions deep inside  
But every road I’ve taken  
Leaves me further behind  
But I’m not giving up  
No, I’m not giving in  
I will not let this end  
Before it begins  

White light, take me home  
I’m surrounded but I’m not alone  
White light, guide me through  
I’ll follow you  

I won’t be afraid  
I won’t turn away  
I won’t be afraid  
I won’t turn away  

White light, take me home  
I’m surrounded but I’m not alone  
White light, guide me through  
I’ll follow you
