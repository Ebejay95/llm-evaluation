You were the perfect girl  
The one who made me feel  
Like I could be whole again  
But now it's just a dream  
A memory that fades  
Into the dark, into the pain  

I see your face in every crowd  
I hear your voice, it's way too loud  
I can't escape, I can't let go  
You're in my mind, you're in my soul  

You were the perfect girl  
But nothing's ever real  
And now I'm lost inside this world  
Of bloody streams and broken seals
