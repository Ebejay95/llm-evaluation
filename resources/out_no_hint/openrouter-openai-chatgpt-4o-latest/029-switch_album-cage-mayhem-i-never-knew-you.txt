I never knew you  
I never knew you  
I never knew you  
I never knew you  

I could've sworn I heard you say amen this morning, darling  
But I was snoring, I was appalling  
I know last night we fought, I went gallivanting  
I got home late, you were storming  
Mad cause I told you I was meeting my boys at the bar  
You found out it was a lie, I was with a girl in a car  
But baby, she meant nothing, I was tipsy and lonely  
You mean the world to me, I want you to hold me  
I want you to scold me, tell me I'm a piece of shit  
Tell me you love me, tell me that you need this  
Tell me that you want this, tell me that you miss me  
Tell me that you hate me, but please don't diss me  
I can't take the silence, I need the violence  
I need the fire in your eyes when you're crying  
I need the love, I need the pain  
I need everything that you gave me again  

I never knew you  
I never knew you  
I never knew you  
I never knew you  

I remember when we met, it was fate, it was perfect  
I was nervous, you were worth it  
I was certain you were the one, I was done searching  
You were like a Sunday morning sermon  
You were like peace, you were like grace  
You were like the sun shining on my face  
You were like music, you were like art  
You were the beat, the rhythm of my heart  
But I messed up, I let you down  
I let my demons run this town  
I let my past dictate my path  
I let the bottle speak on my behalf  
I was wrong, I was weak  
I was lost, I couldn't speak  
Now I'm here, and you're gone  
And I'm singing this song  

I never knew you  
I never knew you  
I never knew you  
I never knew you
