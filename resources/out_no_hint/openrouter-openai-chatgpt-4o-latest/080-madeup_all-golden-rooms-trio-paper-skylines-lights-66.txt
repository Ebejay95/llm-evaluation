Lights flicker in the golden rooms  
Shadows dance beneath the paper moons  
Skylines drawn with trembling hands  
Folded dreams in distant lands  

Whispers echo down the hall  
Footsteps soft, they barely fall  
Hope is stitched in silent seams  
Woven tight through paper dreams  

Neon glows in numbered nights  
Hearts alight in fleeting flights  
Window panes reflect the skies  
In the hush where silence lies  

Golden rooms and paper skylines  
Hold the weight of all our signs  
Lights like stars begin to fade  
But still we shine in what weâ€™ve made
