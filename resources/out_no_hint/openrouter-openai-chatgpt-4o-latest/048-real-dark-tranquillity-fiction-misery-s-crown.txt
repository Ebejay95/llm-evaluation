I'm the misery's crown  
My name is solitude  
And I wear it proud  
Misery's love  
For the lost and found  
Misery's crown  

I am the voice inside your head  
And I control you  
I am the lover in your bed  
And I console you  
I am the sex that you provide  
And I adore you  
I am the lie that you deny  
And I absolve you  

I am the misery's crown  
My name is solitude  
And I wear it proud  
Misery's love  
For the lost and found  
Misery's crown  

I am the reason you deny  
And I control you  
I am the truth behind your lie  
And I console you  
I am the guilt that you deny  
And I adore you  
I am the answer to your prayer  
And I absolve you  

I am the misery's crown  
My name is solitude  
And I wear it proud  
Misery's love  
For the lost and found  
Misery's crown  

I am the misery's crown  
My name is solitude  
And I wear it proud  
Misery's love  
For the lost and found  
Misery's crown
