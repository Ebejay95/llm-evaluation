Emerald waves roll to the shore  
Whispers of the ocean's lore  
Trumpets sound in skies so wide  
Marching green with rising tide  

Parade of light in morning's gleam  
Flowing through a waking dream  
Drums of thunder, winds that play  
Guiding hearts along the bay  

Green river winding through the land  
Carving paths with gentle hand  
Reflections dance in emerald hue  
Carrying hopes the world once knew  

Banners high and spirits free  
Songs that echo endlessly  
In the hush before the rain  
Emerald calls again, again
