I ain't ashamed in the fact that I'm sensitive  
I believe that it is the perfect adjective  
I wear it like a badge, oh, I wear it like a necklace  
Pinned it to my chest, so that you never forget this  

I'm sensitive, I'm not ashamed of it  
Matter of fact, I'm proud and I shout it  
I'm proud and I shout it  

I ain't ashamed in the fact that I'm sensitive  
I believe that it is the perfect adjective  
I wear it like a badge, oh, I wear it like a necklace  
Pinned it to my chest, so that you never forget this  

I'm sensitive, I'm not ashamed of it  
Matter of fact, I'm proud and I shout it  
I'm proud and I shout it  

I am what I am and I'm good at it  
And if you don't like me, well, that isn't fucking relevant  
Don't call me mad, there's a difference, I am angry  
And your choice to call me cute has offended me  

I have clung to your words  
With the claws of an eagle  
But they pale in comparison  
To the typecast of a villain  

I am what I am and I'm good at it  
And if you don't like me, well, that isn't fucking relevant  
Don't call me mad, there's a difference, I am angry  
And your choice to call me cute has offended me  

I have clung to your words  
With the claws of an eagle  
But they pale in comparison  
To the typecast of a villain  

I smile  
I smile  
I smile  
I smile  

I am what I am and I'm good at it  
And if you don't like me, well, that isn't fucking relevant  
Don't call me mad, there's a difference, I am angry  
And your choice to call me cute has offended me  

I have clung to your words  
With the claws of an eagle

I smile  
I smile  
I smile
