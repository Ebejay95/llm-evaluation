Golden letters in the sky  
Spelling out the reasons why  
You and I were meant to be  
Like a secret melody  

Every glance, a mystery  
You pull me in so easily  
Unpredictable, you move  
To a rhythm I can't lose  

Golden letters, shining bright  
Writing stories in the night  
Every moment feels so new  
When I'm dancing close to you
