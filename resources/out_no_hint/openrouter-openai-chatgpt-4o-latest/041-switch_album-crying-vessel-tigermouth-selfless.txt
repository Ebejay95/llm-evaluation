Selfless, I gave it all  
Tore my heart just to watch you fall  
Empty rooms where echoes dwell  
Of promises we used to tell  

Tigermouth, you bite so sweet  
Velvet lies beneath your teeth  
I held on through every storm  
Now I stand, a shape reborn  

Selfless, I fade in you  
A shadow lost in shades of blue  
No more chains, no more sound  
Just silence where love once was found
