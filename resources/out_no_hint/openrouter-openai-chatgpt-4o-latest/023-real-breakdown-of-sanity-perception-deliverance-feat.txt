I see through the lies, the veil you wear  
A mask of virtue, but I know what's there  
Deception runs deep in your hollow stare  
You speak of peace, but you never care  

Perception twisted, truth denied  
You built your throne on the backs of the blind  
A kingdom of silence, a reign of despair  
But I won't bow, I won't be ensnared  

Deliverance from your control  
I reclaim what you stole  
No more chains, no more fear  
I am the voice you refuse to hear  

You can't erase what you've done  
The reckoning has begun  
Your empire will fall  
And I will stand through it all  

I see through the lies, the veil you wear  
A mask of virtue, but I know what's there  
Deliverance from your control  
I reclaim what you stole
