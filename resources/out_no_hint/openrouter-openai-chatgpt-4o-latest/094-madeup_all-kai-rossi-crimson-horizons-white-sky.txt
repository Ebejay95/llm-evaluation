Crimson horizons bleed into white sky  
Shadows stretch long as the day says goodbye  
Footsteps echo on the edge of the light  
Chasing the silence that falls with the night  

Whispers of fire in the cold morning air  
Dreams left behind in the places we dare  
Eyes on the skyline, heart in the flame  
Calling the wind as it murmurs my name  

Crimson horizons, fading to gray  
Time slips like sand as we drift away  
White sky above, no stars to confide  
But still I walk on with hope as my guide
