The truth is on your side  
You said the truth's on your side  
It only matters what they say  
And if they look away  
It's just as well  

The truth is on your side  
You said the truth's on your side  
It only matters what they do  
And if they lie to you  
It's just as well  

Scorpio rising  
Scorpio rising  
Scorpio rising  
Scorpio rising  

Hands around my throat  
Hands around my throat  
Hands around my throat  
Hands around my throat
