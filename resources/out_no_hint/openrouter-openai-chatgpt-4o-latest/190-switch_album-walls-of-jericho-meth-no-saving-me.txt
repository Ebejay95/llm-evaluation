I can feel it taking over me  
This sickness in my skin  
I wonder if I'll ever be  
The one I was again  

Every day I feel the weight  
Of what I've done and what I've seen  
But there's no one else to blame  
This hell is home to me  

No saving me  
No saving me  
I've gone too far  
I've lost control  
No saving me  
No saving me  
I've made my bed  
Now let me go  

I never wanted to be this way  
But it's all I've ever known  
I tried to fight, I tried to change  
But the devil won't let go  

No saving me  
No saving me  
I've gone too far  
I've lost control  
No saving me  
No saving me  
I've made my bed  
Now let me go  

This is the end of everything  
This is the end of me  
This is the end of everything  
This is the end of me  

No saving me  
No saving me  
I've gone too far  
I've lost control  
No saving me  
No saving me  
I've made my bed  
Now let me go
