She got the devil in her eyes  
She got the devil in her eyes  
She got the devil in her eyes  
And she’s gonna hypnotize  

She’s my witch  
She’s my witch  

She got the moon in her hair  
She got the moon in her hair  
She got the moon in her hair  
And magic everywhere  

She’s my witch  
She’s my witch  

Some girls look just like a rose  
Sweet and soft and warm I suppose  
But my girl’s got a heart of stone  
Can’t you hear her long wolf moan  

She’s my witch  
She’s my witch  

She’s the devil’s pride  
She’s the devil’s pride  
She’s the devil’s pride  
And I’m satisfied  

She’s my witch  
She’s my witch
