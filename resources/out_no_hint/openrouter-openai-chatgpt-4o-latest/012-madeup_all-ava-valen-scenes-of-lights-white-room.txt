Scenes of lights in the white room  
Shadows dance on the wall  
Echoes of a distant memory  
I can almost hear it call  

Flickers of gold and silver  
Paint the silence with grace  
Time stands still for a moment  
In this quiet, sacred place  

Breath held in the stillness  
Eyes wide in the glow  
The world outside forgotten  
In the hush of the afterglow  

Scenes of lights in the white room  
Where dreams begin to bloom  
A whisper in the silence  
A promise through the gloom
