It's written in the stars, baby, that's just how it goes  
I knew you'd be mine from the moment I suppose  
Destiny aligned, now we're dancing through the lows  
Every step we take, yeah, the universe knows  

Champagne dreams and a Cadillac ride  
Golden hour love with you right by my side  
A toast to the nights we won't forget  
It's written, baby, no need to second-guess  

From the first glance, I could feel the spark  
Like a scene from a movie, straight out the dark  
Now we're shining bright, lighting up the charts  
It's written in our hearts, yeah, that's the art
