I fell out of heaven  
To be with you in hell  
My sins not quite seven  
Nothing much to tell  

Lust  
It's a matter of trust  
Lust  
It's a matter of trust  

You say you don't want me  
But I know it's a lie  
'Cause when I look at you, baby  
I see the desire in your eyes  

Lust  
It's a matter of trust  
Lust  
It's a matter of trust  

I know where you're going  
I know where you've been  
I know what you're doing  
And I know where you've sinned  

Lust  
It's a matter of trust  
Lust  
It's a matter of trust
