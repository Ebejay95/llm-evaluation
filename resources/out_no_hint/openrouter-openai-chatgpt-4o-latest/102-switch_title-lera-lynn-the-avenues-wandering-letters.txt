Wandering letters  
Scattered on the floor  
Left by the others  
Who don't live here anymore  

I read through the pages  
Of heartache and loss  
The ink has all faded  
But I still know the cost  

These wandering letters  
They don't have a home  
Just like the sender  
Always alone  

They speak of a longing  
That time couldn't mend  
Of love that was fleeting  
Of means to an end  

Wandering letters  
Carried by the breeze  
Whispers of sorrow  
That never found peace
