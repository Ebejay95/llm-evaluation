Green light in the distance, calling me home  
Velvet patterns on the walls where I roam  
Shadows stretch long in the amber glow  
Fading horizons, where the wild winds blow  

Steps echo softly on the midnight floor  
Memories linger behind every door  
Whispers of laughter, echoes of pain  
Caught in the silence, like a gentle rain  

Green light flickers in the corner of my eye  
A promise of something I canâ€™t deny  
Velvet dreams wrapped in silver thread  
Leading me forward where angels have tread  

Fading horizons, I chase them still  
Over the valley, beyond the hill  
Green light burning, steady and true  
Guiding me always, back to you
