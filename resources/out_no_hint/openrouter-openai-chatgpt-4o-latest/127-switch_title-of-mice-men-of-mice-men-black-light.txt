I see a black light  
Stretching out over me  
I see a black light  
Guiding me through the grief  
I see a black light  
Stretching out over me  
I see a black light  
Guiding me through the grief  

I feel the weight  
Of a thousand eyes  
Watching me as I  
Try to survive  
I feel the weight  
Of a thousand lies  
Dragging me down  
But I’m still alive  

I see a black light  
Stretching out over me  
I see a black light  
Guiding me through the grief  
I see a black light  
Stretching out over me  
I see a black light  
Guiding me through the grief  

I feel the pull  
Of a world gone cold  
Trying to take  
What it can’t control  
I feel the pull  
Of a world gone cold  
But I won’t break  
I won’t let go  

I see a black light  
Stretching out over me  
I see a black light  
Guiding me through the grief  
I see a black light  
Stretching out over me  
I see a black light  
Guiding me through the grief  

I see a black light  
I see a black light  
I see a black light  
I see a black light
