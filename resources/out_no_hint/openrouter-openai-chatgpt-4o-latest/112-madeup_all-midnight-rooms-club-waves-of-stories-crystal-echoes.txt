Midnight rooms club, where the silence hums  
Waves of stories crash, where the memory runs  
Crystal echoes fall from the chandelier light  
Whispers of the past dancing into the night  

Velvet shadows stretch on the marbled floor  
Footsteps of secrets behind every door  
Laughter in fragments, frozen in time  
A symphony of ghosts in rhythm and rhyme  

Mirrors reflect what we try to forget  
Moments suspended in a silver vignette  
Hearts beat slow in the hush of the gloom  
Lost in the pulse of the midnight room  

Waves of stories, tide of the soul  
Crashing and curling, never in control  
Crystal echoes ring, fragile and clear  
Telling the tales we no longer hear
