We are not the same  
I am so alive  
I'm made of glass and you of flame  
But I will shatter  
Burn and scatter  
You can't take this away from me  

We are not the same  
I am everything you can't control  
I am nothing you can hold  
We are not the same  
I am everything you can't control  
I am nothing you can hold  

We are  
We are  
We are  
We are  

We are not the same  
I am so alive  
I'm made of glass and you of flame  
But I will shatter  
Burn and scatter  
You can't take this away from me  

We are not the same  
I am everything you can't control  
I am nothing you can hold  
We are not the same  
I am everything you can't control  
I am nothing you can hold  

We are  
We are  
We are  
We are  

We are not the same  
I am everything you can't control  
I am nothing you can hold  
We are not the same  
I am everything you can't control  
I am nothing you can hold  

We are  
We are  
We are  
We are
