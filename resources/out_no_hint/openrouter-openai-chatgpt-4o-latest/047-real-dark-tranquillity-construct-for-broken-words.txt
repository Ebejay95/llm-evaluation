No!  
I cannot see  
You will not be  
By my side  

No!  
I won't believe  
You won't deceive  
My broken mind  

A vision  
A promise  
A sacrifice  
Like all the rest  

I never wanted  
To be the one  
To bear the cross  
Of all your sins  

For broken words  
We pay the price  
Torn from within  
Severed in mind  

No!  
I cannot feel  
You won't reveal  
What lies beneath  

No!  
I won't concede  
You won't relieve  
My disbelief  

A vision  
A promise  
A sacrifice  
Like all the rest  

I never wanted  
To be the one  
To bear the cross  
Of all your sins  

For broken words  
We pay the price  
Torn from within  
Severed in mind  

For broken words  
We pay the price  
Torn from within  
Severed in mind
