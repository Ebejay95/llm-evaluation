Dreams flicker in the silence  
Neon whispers trace the air  
Shadows dance in fevered motion  
Lost in moments we can't share  

Glass reflections hold our secrets  
Fragments scattered in the night  
Rooms of echoes, pulsing gently  
Guided only by the light  

We are drifting through the shimmer  
Time dissolves in colored streams  
Every heartbeat paints a vision  
In this labyrinth of dreams  

Hold me close inside the static  
Let the noise become our song  
Even if the dawn forgets us  
In this fever, we belong
