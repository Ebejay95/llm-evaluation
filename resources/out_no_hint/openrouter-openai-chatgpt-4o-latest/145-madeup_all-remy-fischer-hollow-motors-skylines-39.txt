Skylines flicker in the rearview  
Neon ghosts in the pouring rain  
We drove past the edge of silence  
Chasing echoes down the interstate  

Your voice a shadow in the static  
Fading like a song I used to know  
The city sleeps beneath our memories  
While we burn out slow  

Hollow motors hum our secrets  
Tires whisper truths we never said  
Every mile a little further  
From the life we left for dead  

Skylines blur into the morning  
Ashes drifting in the light  
We were never meant for endings  
Just a spark against the night
