Emerald skies above the bay  
Whispers float where moonbeams play  
City lights in silent streams  
Guide me through my emerald dreams  

Velvet shadows brush the street  
Echoes hum in soft heartbeat  
Time dissolves in glowing beams  
Wrapped inside these emerald dreams  

Drifting past the midnight tide  
Hope and wonder coincide  
In this world of quiet gleams  
I find peace in emerald dreams
