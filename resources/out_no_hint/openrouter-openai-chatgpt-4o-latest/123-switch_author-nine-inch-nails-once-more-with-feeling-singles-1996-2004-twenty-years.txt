This isn't meant to last  
This is for right now  
I know it's all about the taste  
I know it's all about the sound  

I know it won't be long  
Until they move on  
And I know because I know  
They don't really feel  

A thing  
For me  
A thing  
For me  

This isn't meant to last

And I know because I know  
They don't really feel  

A thing  
For me  
A thing  
For me  

A thing  
For me  
A thing
