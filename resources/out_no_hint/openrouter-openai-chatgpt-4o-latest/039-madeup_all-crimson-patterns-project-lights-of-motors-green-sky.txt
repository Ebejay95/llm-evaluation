Crimson patterns project  
Lights of motors  
Green sky above me  
Flickering notions  
In the hum of the city  

Neon veins pulse  
Through concrete dreams  
Reflections shimmer  
On glass and steel  

I walk through echoes  
Of a future past  
Where silence speaks  
In electric contrast  

Crimson patterns project  
On walls that breathe  
Lights of motors  
Never sleep  

Green sky watching  
With a static gaze  
Time dissolves  
In synthetic haze
