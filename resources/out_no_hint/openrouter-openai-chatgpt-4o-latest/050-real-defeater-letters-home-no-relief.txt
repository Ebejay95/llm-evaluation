No hope, no peace  
Just a bitter taste left in your mouth  
From all the things you couldn't be  
All the things you couldn't change  
No sleep, no relief  
Just a shadow hanging over me  
Like a cross I couldn't bear  
Like a weight I couldn't lift  

No hope, no peace  
Just a bitter taste left in your mouth  
From all the things you couldn't be  
All the things you couldn't change  
No sleep, no relief  
Just a shadow hanging over me  
Like a cross I couldn't bear  
Like a weight I couldn't lift
