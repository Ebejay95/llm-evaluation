Break the silence, say the words  
If it's the last time, let me hear  
The sound of your voice, the truth in your eyes  
Don't hold back, don't tell me lies  

This is the end, the final breath  
The sun is setting, embracing death  
No more chances, no more time  
This is the last sunset, yours and mine  

Break the chains, release the pain  
Let it all fall like pouring rain  
No regrets, no looking back  
We walked this road, now fade to black
