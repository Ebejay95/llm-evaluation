Crimson scenes in silent halls  
Whispers echo down the walls  
Shadows stretch where light once lay  
Truth and myth begin to fray  

Black lines drawn on paper thin  
Stories lost where dreams begin  
Fading fables, torn apart  
Etched in ink, a bleeding heart  

Crimson stains on pages worn  
Tales of love and kingdoms torn  
Eyes that see but do not weep  
Secrets buried far too deep  

Black line winds through every page  
Marking time, the turning age  
Fading fables, voices dim  
Calling out from where we've been
