I can't feel you  
You don't feel me  
We are not real  
You can't stop me  
I am the vice grip  
I am the vice grip  

I can't love you  
You can't hurt me  
We are not real  
You can't stop me  
I am the vice grip  
I am the vice grip  

I can't feel you  
You don't feel me  
We are not real  
You can't stop me  
I am the vice grip  
I am the vice grip
