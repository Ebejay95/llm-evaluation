Digital motors hum in time  
Circuits pulse with silent rhyme  
Wires weave a silver thread  
Through the thoughts inside my head  

Neon dreams begin to glow  
In the code, the currents flow  
Every spark a whispered name  
In this dance of light and flame  

Glass and metal, breath and spark  
Guided by a question mark  
What is real and what is made  
In the shadow, in the shade  

Digital motors, start the song  
Where the lost and found belong  
Prelude to a world anew  
Built from bits and born from you
