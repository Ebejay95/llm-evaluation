The past is only the future with the lights on  
And the future is a flake  
I am just a fuse  
Blown out  
Make no mistake  
I love you  

I love you  

The morning seems so grey  
So unlike yesterday  
Now’s the time for us to say  

Happy new year  
Happy new year  
May we all have a vision now and then  
Of a world where every neighbor is a friend  
Happy new year  
Happy new year  
May we all have our hopes, our will to try  
If we don’t, we might as well lay down and die  
You and I
