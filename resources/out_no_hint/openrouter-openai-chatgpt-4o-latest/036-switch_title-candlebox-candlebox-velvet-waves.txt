Velvet waves crash down on me  
Wash away my sanity  
In your eyes, I see the tide  
Pulling me to the other side  

Whispers float on salted air  
Promises that disappear  
Driftwood hearts we try to save  
Carried off by velvet waves  

Hold me close, then let me go  
Like the moon commands the flow  
Every touch, a sweet escape  
Drowning slow in velvet waves  

No shoreline to call my own  
Just your voice, a siren's tone  
Lost between the love and pain  
Sinking deep in velvet waves
