Whispers in the dark, they call my name  
Fading echoes of a world I couldn't tame  
Pages turned with hands unseen  
In the silence, what does it mean?  

Footsteps lost in corridors of time  
Memories linger, no reason, no rhyme  
A final breath beneath the stars  
Carrying wounds like ancient scars  

The night holds secrets I can't erase  
Reflections vanish without a trace  
But in the stillness, I find my way  
A quiet end to a restless day  

No need for words, the story's told  
In empty rooms and hearts grown cold  
Yet in the hush, a spark remains  
A silent hope through all the pain  

So let the silence speak for me  
In every shadow, let it be  
The closing line, the final page  
A whispered truth beyond the cage
