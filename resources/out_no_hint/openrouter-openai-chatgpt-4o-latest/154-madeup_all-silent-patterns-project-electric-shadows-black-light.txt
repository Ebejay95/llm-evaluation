Electric shadows on the wall  
Flicker fast then slowly fall  
Silent patterns in the night  
Drawn in black and silver light  

Whispers echo through the haze  
Frozen moments, fractured days  
Neon pulses in the rain  
Tracing lines that can't remain  

Black light bleeding through the seams  
Waking half-forgotten dreams  
Figures move but leave no trace  
Vanishing without a face  

Electric shadows, silent cries  
Reflections caught in static skies  
Patterns shifting out of sight  
Lost beneath the blackest light
