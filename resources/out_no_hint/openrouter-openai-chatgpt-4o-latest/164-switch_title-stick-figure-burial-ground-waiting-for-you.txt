I’ve been waiting for you  
And I’ll be waiting ‘til the end of time  
I’ve been waiting for you  
And I’ll be waiting ‘til the end of time  

I’ve seen the flame burn down  
I’ve seen the waters rise  
I’ve seen the world turn ‘round  
And I’ve seen the same old lies  
I’ve felt the fire burn  
I’ve felt the coldest nights  
I’ve seen the tides they turn  
But I’m still standing right  

I’ve been waiting for you  
And I’ll be waiting ‘til the end of time  
I’ve been waiting for you  
And I’ll be waiting ‘til the end of time  

I’ve seen the sun go down  
I’ve seen the morning light  
I’ve felt the thundercloud  
And I’ve seen the darkest skies  
I’ve heard the silence loud  
I’ve heard the war and cries  
I’ve seen the lost get found  
And I’ve seen the blind get sight  

I’ve been waiting for you  
And I’ll be waiting ‘til the end of time  
I’ve been waiting for you  
And I’ll be waiting ‘til the end of time  

I’ve been waiting for you  
And I’ll be waiting ‘til the end of time  
I’ve been waiting for you  
And I’ll be waiting ‘til the end of time
