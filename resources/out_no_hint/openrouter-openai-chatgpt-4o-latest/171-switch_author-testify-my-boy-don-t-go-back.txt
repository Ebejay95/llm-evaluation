Testify, my boy, don't go back  
Hold your ground on the one-way track  
Voices call from the shadowed past  
But the fire in your heart must last  

Chains may rattle, winds may cry  
But you were born to rise and fly  
Testify, my boy, stand tall and true  
The road ahead belongs to you  

Don't go back to the days of doubt  
Let your soul speak clear and loud  
Testify, let the silence break  
With every step that you dare to take
