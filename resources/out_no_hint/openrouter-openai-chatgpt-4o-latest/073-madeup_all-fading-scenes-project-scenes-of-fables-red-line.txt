Red line drawn across the sky  
Marks the place where dreams go by  
Whispers echo through the haze  
Tales retold in crimson blaze  

Footsteps lost in shifting sand  
Time slips through an open hand  
Mirrors crack with silent cries  
Truth concealed in woven lies  

Shadows dance on painted walls  
Hope will rise and sometimes fall  
Fables etched in twilight's gleam  
Drift away like a distant dream
