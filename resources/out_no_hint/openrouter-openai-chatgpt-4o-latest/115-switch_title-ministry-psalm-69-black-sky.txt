Black sky  
Black sky  

I am the angel  
Of the black sky  
Clouds of smoke  
Are covering the light  

I am the insect  
Crawling up your spine  
I am the insect  
Crawling into your mind  

Black sky  
Black sky  

I am the cancer  
Eating at your soul  
I am the answer  
You've never been told  

I am the poison  
That feeds your pride  
I am the answer  
That you can't hide  

Black sky  
Black sky  

I am the needle  
That brings you down  
I am the demon  
That you can't drown  

I am the splinter  
Under your skin  
I am the nightmare  
That draws you in  

Black sky  
Black sky
