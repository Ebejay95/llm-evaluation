Wild Bill was a man  
Out of place and out of time  
He'd kill you for a quarter

People crossed the street  
When they saw him near  
He drank like a fish  
And he cussed like a mule  
He'd break every law  
And spit on every rule

In a barroom fight  
A stranger in black  
Stepped into the light  
They stared each other down  
With a cold, dead gaze  
Then the smoke cleared  
And ended Bill's days  

Wild Bill, Wild Bill  
A legend in the dust  
Wild Bill, Wild Bill  
Gone because he must
