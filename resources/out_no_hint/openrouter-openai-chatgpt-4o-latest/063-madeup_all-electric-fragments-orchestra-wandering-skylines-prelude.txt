Wandering through skylines, electric and wide  
Fragments of silence where daylights collide  
Currents of memory drift in the haze  
Echoes of futures in luminous maze  

Signals are pulsing in rhythm and light  
Tracing the outlines of dreams in the night  
Hovering thoughts in a circuitry stream  
Prelude to motion, the start of a dream
