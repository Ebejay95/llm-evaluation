I am the voice inside your head  
And I control you  
I am the lover in your bed  
And I caress you  
I am the dream that haunts your sleep  
And makes you sleepless  
I am the tear you cannot weep  
The hidden sadness  

I am the truth you try to hide  
The lie you live with  
I am the guilt you feel inside  
The pain you deal with  
I am the touch you miss so much  
The one you long for  
I am the time you cannot stop  
The past you die for  

My fiction beauty  
You're just a dream  
My fiction beauty  
You're not real  
My fiction beauty  
You're just a dream  
My fiction beauty  
You're not real  

I am the voice inside your head  
And I control you  
I am the lover in your bed  
And I caress you  
I am the dream that haunts your sleep  
And makes you sleepless  
I am the tear you cannot weep  
The hidden sadness  

My fiction beauty  
You're just a dream  
My fiction beauty  
You're not real  
My fiction beauty  
You're just a dream  
My fiction beauty  
You're not real  

You're not real  
You're not real  
You're not real  
You're not real
