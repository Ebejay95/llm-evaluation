Words of the dying  
Echo in the wind  
Whispers of the fallen  
Calling out again  

Shadows on the hillside  
Smoke is in the sky  
Memories like fire  
Burning in the eye  

No one left to answer  
No one left to hear  
Only fading voices  
Carried by the fear  

Words of the dying  
Written in the dust  
Truth that we abandoned  
Ashes of our trust  

Silence is the witness  
To all that we have done  
And the words of the dying  
Are the last for everyone
