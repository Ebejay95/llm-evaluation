Aurora lights in endless streams  
Dancing through our midnight dreams  
Colors burst in silent skies  
Whispers where the starlight lies  

Parade of hues in frozen air  
Spirits move without a care  
Shadows fade beneath the glow  
Time dissolves in waves of snow  

Endless scenes that never sleep  
Secrets in the heavens keep  
Marching lights in quiet flight  
Painting dark with northern light
