I see your face  
In the mirror of my mind  
I see your face  
And I know it's time  

You move so fast  
Through the desert of my dreams  
You move so fast  
Like a laser beam  

The trip  
The trip  
The trip  
The trip  

It's all a game  
We're dancing in the rain  
It's all a game  
I can feel no pain  

You take my hand  
Lead me to the sand  
You take my hand  
So I can barely stand  

The trip  
The trip  
The trip  
The trip  

I see your face  
In the mirror of my mind  
I see your face  
And I know it's time  

The trip  
The trip  
The trip  
The trip
