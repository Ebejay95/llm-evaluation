Gift  
No more going to the dark side  
With your flying saucer eyes  
No more falling down a wormhole  
That I have to pull you out  
The wriggling twiggling  
Cosmic fallen  
Has a name  
I’m the one  
I’m the one  
He’s my friend  
He’s my alibi  
My accessory to the crime  
A bond that will never die  
Till the end of time  
Till the end of time  

Sacred Trickster  
I want you  
To levitate me  
Don’t you love me yet?  
Press up  
Against the amp  
Turn up the treble  
Don’t forget  
I’m not trying  
To make you  
Think this is some  
Kind of art  
I live on the edge  
Of the city limits  
I’m your  
Sacred trickster  
Psychic dancer  
Evil is the truth  
That we invent  
Like the air  
And the stars  
It’s nothing like  
We think it is  
It’s what we’ve been  
Told to feel  
Like the air  
And the stars
