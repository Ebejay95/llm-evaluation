Midnight fragments fall like rain  
Through neon scenes we can't explain  
Reflections dance on mirrored skies  
In crystal lights, the city lies  

Shadows flicker, pulse and glow  
Time moves fast, then soft and slow  
Electric dreams in silent flight  
We chase the dawn, escape the night  

Glass towers hum a lullaby  
To sleepless hearts that wonder why  
In every spark, a story gleams  
Of broken hopes and midnight dreams  

So hold me close beneath the beams  
Of crystal lights and neon scenes
