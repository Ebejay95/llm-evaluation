Fever horizons in electric skies  
Neon reflections in your eyes  
Running through circuits, chasing the night  
Wired for dreaming, bathed in light  

Pulse of the city under our skin  
Voltage rising deep within  
Shadows flicker, stories unfold  
In the static, secrets told  

Burning bright, we never sleep  
Promises the silence keeps  
Fevered hearts in coded tones  
Electric shadows, all alone
