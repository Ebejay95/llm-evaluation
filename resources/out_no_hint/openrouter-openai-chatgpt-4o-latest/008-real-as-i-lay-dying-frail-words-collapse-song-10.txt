How can you justify your actions?  
With the evidence in front of your face  
You boldly point your finger  
With no respect, you disgrace  

You disgrace the name you were given  
You disgrace the name you were given  

How can you justify your actions?  
With the evidence in front of your face  
You boldly point your finger  
With no respect, you disgrace  

You disgrace the name you were given  
You disgrace the name you were given  

You were one of the few  
That I could trust  
Now the truth  
Has made it’s way to the surface  

Now the truth  
Has made it’s way to the surface  
Now the truth  
Has made it’s way to the surface
