Rag doll blues and a paper heart  
Cut too deep, now it falls apart  
Stitches loose where the seams once held  
In a silent room where the echoes dwelled  

Scissors sharp with a silver gleam  
Snipping threads from a broken dream  
Hands once warm now cold and still  
Left me hollow, against my will  

Buttons for eyes, can't cry no more  
Lying crumpled on the wooden floor  
Tangled yarn where love once grew  
Rag doll blues, and I'm missing you  

Snip-snap sounds in the dead of night  
Cutting ties that once felt right  
Patch me up or let me go  
Scissors dance in the afterglow
