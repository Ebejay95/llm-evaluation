Yo, in a me zone, me a roam  
But no man a go clone  
'Cause me style me a own  
And me no smell no cologne  
Got me girl dem a moan  
When me DJ a tone  
And me lyrics dem a fling like a stone  

'Cause me a real microphone controller  
A dancehall veteran, soldier  
When me come a dance, me no roll over  
Any sound test, get run over  

Nobody, nobody get hurt  
Blow dem up like a bomb in a skirt  
Nobody, nobody get hurt  
Blow dem up like a bomb in a skirt

When me come a dance, me a fly high  
Me no tell no lie
