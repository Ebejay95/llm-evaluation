(I’ve seen the world through your eyes...)  
This is the beginning of the end  
The final chapter of my life  
I’ve seen the world through your eyes  
And now I know that I’ve been blind  

You’re my fiction beauty  
The ghost that’s haunting me  
You’re my fiction beauty  
The ghost that’s haunting me  

I’ve tasted the poison on your lips  
And felt the fire in your kiss  
You’re the angel of my fall  
The one who made me lose it all  

You’re my fiction beauty  
The ghost that’s haunting me  
You’re my fiction beauty  
The ghost that’s haunting me  

(Why can’t I let you go?)  
(Why can’t I let you go?)  

You’re my fiction beauty  
The ghost that’s haunting me  
You’re my fiction beauty  
The ghost that’s haunting me
