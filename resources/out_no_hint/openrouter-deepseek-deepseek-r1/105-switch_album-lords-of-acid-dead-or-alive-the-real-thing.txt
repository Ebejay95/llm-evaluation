**Lords of Acid - "I Sit on Acid"**  
I sit on acid  
I sit on acid  
I sit on acid  
I sit on acid  

**Dead Or Alive - "You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)"**  
You spin me right 'round, baby  
Right 'round like a record, baby  
Right 'round, 'round, 'round  
You spin me right 'round, baby  
Right 'round like a record, baby  
Right 'round, 'round, 'round  

**The Real Thing - "You to Me Are Everything"**  
You're my sun, you're my rain  
You're the lover I don't contain  
You're my pain, you're my pleasure  
You're the treasure that I'd die to measure
