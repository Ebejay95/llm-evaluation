[Verse]  
Walking through the haze, shadows in my mind  
Echoes of your voice, I can't leave behind  
Flickers of the past, they dance in the night  
Searching for a truth hidden out of sight  

[Chorus]  
One by one, the pieces fall  
In lucid dreams, I hear your call  
Through the void, I reach for you  
In this endless sky, our love renews  

[Verse 2]  
Silent whispers float on the edge of time  
Fragments of a world where our souls align  
Colors bleed to gray, yet your light remains  
Guiding me through the chaos, breaking these chains  

[Chorus]  
One by one, the pieces fall  
In lucid dreams, I hear your call  
Through the void, I reach for you  
In this endless sky, our love renews  

[Bridge]  
Distant stars ignite, tracing paths unknown  
In the quiet storm, weâ€™re never alone  
Every shadow fades when your hand finds mine  
Forever intertwined, beyond the divide  

[Chorus]  
One by one, the pieces fall  
In lucid dreams, I hear your call  
Through the void, I reach for you  
In this endless sky, our love renews
