Between two points, there’s a line of sight  
A silent thread in the fabric of time  
We trace the arcs of a borrowed light  
A fading spark in the wake of the climb  

The distance pulls like a phantom limb  
Echoes scatter where the voices begin  
We map the void with a fractured hymn  
A hollow note where the worlds cave in  

Between two points, the tension grows  
A bridge of shadows where the current flows  
We grasp for truths that nobody knows  
A fragile thread as the pendulum slows  

The weight of years bends the path we’ve made  
A fading pulse in the noise of the fray  
We drift like dust through the roles we’ve played  
A borrowed breath till it’s swept away
