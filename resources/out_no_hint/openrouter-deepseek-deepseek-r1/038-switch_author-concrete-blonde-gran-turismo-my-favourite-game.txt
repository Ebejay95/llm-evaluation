---  
**Verse 1**  
I don't know what I'm doing wrong  
Maybe I should do it right, for once  
We could be together  
Every day together  
We could sit around and wonder  
What took us so long  

**Chorus**  
This is my favourite game  
This is my favourite game  
This is my favourite game  
This is my favourite game  

**Verse 2**  
I don't know what I'm supposed to do  
Maybe I should try to think like you  
We could stay together  
Hate each other forever  
You can wonder  
I'll wonder what I'm doing here  

**Chorus**  
This is my favourite game  
This is my favourite game  
This is my favourite game  
This is my favourite game  

**Bridge**  
Wait, don't say a word  
This is my favourite game  
I will say the last word  
You will not  

**Outro**  
This is my favourite game  
This is my favourite game  
This is my favourite game  
This is my favourite game
