**Verse 1**  
Shadows dance on the wall, a silent film replaying,  
Footsteps fade in the hall, the night is softly praying.  
Whispers cling to the air, a name I can’t forget,  
Etched in dust and despair, a ghost I haven’t met.  

**Pre-Chorus**  
Echoes chase the wind, a melody unspoken,  
Fragments of a hymn where every vow was broken.  

**Chorus**  
Hidden echoes call your name in the hollow of my veins,  
Through the cracks where light once came, I trace the scars that still remain.  
In the silence, shadows bleed, a portrait painted in the grey,  
Hidden echoes plead—don’t let me fade away.  

**Verse 2**  
Flicker of a streetlight, a lullaby of rain,  
Memories take flight, but the ache will still remain.  
Photographs turn to dust, their colors washed to stone,  
A clockwork heart we trust, yet time leaves us alone.  

**Pre-Chorus**  
Voices twist in the breeze, a labyrinth of sound,  
Tangled in the trees, but you’re nowhere to be found.  

**Chorus**  
Hidden echoes call your name in the hollow of my veins,  
Through the cracks where light once came, I trace the scars that still remain.  
In the silence, shadows bleed, a portrait painted in the grey,  
Hidden echoes plead—don’t let me fade away.  

**Bridge**  
I reach for the edge of a dream half-remembered,  
A touch on my sleeve, but the cold dismembers.  
The stars hold their breath, the moon starts to sever,  
A threadbare requiem—lost to forever.  

**Chorus**  
Hidden echoes call your name in the hollow of my veins,  
Through the cracks where light once came, I trace the scars that still remain.  
In the silence, shadows bleed, a portrait painted in the grey,  
Hidden echoes plead—don’t let me fade away.  

**Outro**  
The night folds its hands, the world stops pretending,  
Echoes sink like sand—here’s where the ending begins…
