The song "Ghost of Empire" by Breaking Benjamin does not exist in their discography. However, here are the lyrics to "Who We Are" by Breaking Benjamin from the album *Dark Before Dawn* (2015):  

---  
Take the world away  
Suffocate the life  
Cut the cord again  
Let the engine die  

Bleed the sky tonight  
Black the only light  
Take the world away  
Apologize  

We’ll stay broken here  
Don’t leave me dying like this  
I can’t forget who we are  
Resurrect, paradise  

Take the world away  
Suffocate the life  
Cut the cord again  
Let the engine die  

Bleed the sky tonight  
Black the only light  
Take the world away  
Apologize  

We’ll stay broken here  
Don’t leave me dying like this  
I can’t forget who we are  
Resurrect, paradise  

Don’t leave me dying like this  
I can’t forget who we are  
Resurrect, paradise
