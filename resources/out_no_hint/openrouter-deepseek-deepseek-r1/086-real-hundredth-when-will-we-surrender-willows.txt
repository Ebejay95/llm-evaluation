Drifting through the haze  
A silhouette of days  
Frozen in the wake  
Of all our worst mistakes  

The current pulls us under  
Crumbling like thunder  
When will we surrender?  
The weight is breaking tender  

Echoes in the fray  
A voice we can’t obey  
Burning in the ache  
To find a new escape  

The current pulls us under  
Crumbling like thunder  
When will we surrender?  
The weight is breaking tender  

(We’re falling faster)  
(We’re falling faster)  
(We’re falling faster)  
(We’re falling faster)
