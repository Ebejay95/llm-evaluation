(Instrumental intro)  

Neon rivers flow beneath the steel,  
Engines hum where the night conceals,  
A thousand eyes in the gridline glow,  
Machines whisper secrets only circuits know.  

*Chorus:*  
Lights of motors carve the haze,  
Green sky bleeding through the maze,  
We are echoes in the static hum,  
Drowning in the buzz of a dying sun.  

Code and copper, veins exposed,  
Data storms where the void transposed,  
Flicker, fracture, the signal dies,  
Ghosts of tomorrow in the rearview’s eyes.  

*Chorus:*  
Lights of motors carve the haze,  
Green sky bleeding through the maze,  
We are echoes in the static hum,  
Drowning in the buzz of a dying sun.  

(Instrumental break)  

Ash and embers, circuits rust,  
Horizons choked in electric dust,  
The future’s a relic we left behind,  
A fractured world where the wires unwind.  

*Chorus (reprise):*  
Lights of motors fade to gray,  
Green sky shatters, night gives way,  
We are echoes in the static hum,  
Silent now—the machines are done.  

(Outro fades to silence)
