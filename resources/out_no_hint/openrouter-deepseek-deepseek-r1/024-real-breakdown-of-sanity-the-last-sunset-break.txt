**Lyrics for "The Last Sunset" by Breakdown of Sanity**:  

This is the last sunset I will ever see...  
The final moments of clarity.  

I can feel the darkness closing in,  
But I won’t let it take me again.  

This is the last sunset, the end of the road,  
But I’ll keep holding on, I won’t let go.  

Break through the silence, scream out my name!  
This is the end, but I’m not afraid.  

The last sunset fades away,  
But in the darkness, I’ll find my way.
