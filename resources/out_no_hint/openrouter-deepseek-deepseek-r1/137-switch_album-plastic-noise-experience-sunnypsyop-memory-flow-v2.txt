[Verse 1]  
Fragments of time slip through my hands  
Digital echoes in static lands  
Circuits rewrite what we used to know  
A memory flow  

[Chorus]  
Data streams collide, rewrite the code  
Lost in the glitch where the shadows erode  
Neon veins pulse, binary glow  
Forever trapped in the memory flow  

[Verse 2]  
Ghosts in the machine whisper my name  
Flickering pixels dissolve into flame  
Past and future merge, undefined  
A fracture of mind  

[Outro]  
Silent servers hum, the void grows wide  
Eternal loopâ€”nowhere to hide  
Upload, delete, repeat, reload  
Drowning in the memory flow
