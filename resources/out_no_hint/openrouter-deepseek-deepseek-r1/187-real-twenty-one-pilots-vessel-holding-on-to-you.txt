I'm taking over my body  
Back in control, no more shotty  
I bet a lot of me was lost  
T's uncrossed and I's undotted  
I fought it a lot  
And it seems a lot  
Like flesh is all I got  
Not anymore, flesh out the door  
Swat  

I must've forgot, you can't trust me  
I'm open, closed, shut and released  
And I'm caught in the grip  
Of a mental fist  
And it's making me a threat  
So let me get, let me get  
Let me get, let me get  
To the point I'm makin'  

Lean with it, rock with it  
When we gonna stop with it?  
Lyrics that mean nothing  
We were gifted with thought  
Is it time to move our feet  
To an introspective beat?  
It ain't the speakers that bump hearts  
It's our hearts that make the beat  

So won't you stay alive, I'll take you on a ride  
I will make you believe you are lovely  
You've been stuck in a lift, in the belly of a whale  
At the bottom of the ocean  
Like a shell on the shore  
With the sea in the swell  
You are swelling, you are swelling  
You are swelling, you are swelling  

No, I don't believe the hype  
And you know you're a terrible sight  
But you'll be just fine  
Just don't believe the hype  
And you know you're a terrible sight  
But you'll be just fine  
Just don't believe the hype  

But I'm not the one you know  
The one that's gone  
But I will admit to the truth  
That I am only a man  
With a candle to guide me  
I take a stand to discard  
Decrepit carapace  
And melt it off, head to toe  

So tie a noose around your mind  
Loose enough to breathe fine and tie it  
To a tree, tell it, "You belong to me  
This ain't a noose, this is a leash  
And I have news for you, you must obey me"  

So enter the night  
Things will be right  
Tuck in your head  
You fell out of the light  
Exit the sight  
And off of his chest  
But this is not  
This is not  
This is not a test, uh  

So won't you stay alive, I'll take you on a ride  
I will make you believe you are lovely  
You've been stuck in a lift, in the belly of a whale  
At the bottom of the ocean  
Like a shell on the shore  
With the sea in the swell  
You are swelling, you are swelling  
You are swelling, you are swelling  

No, I don't believe the hype  
And you know you're a terrible sight  
But you'll be just fine  
Just don't believe the hype  
And you know you're a terrible sight  
But you'll be just fine  
Just don't believe the hype
