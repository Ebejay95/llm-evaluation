This is a white light  
A beacon in the darkest night  
When everything around you seems to crumble and fall  
Stand your ground, donâ€™t let them see you crawl  

Stick to your guns  
Stick to your guns  
Stick to your guns  
Stick to your guns  

When the weight of the world is crushing down  
And your knees hit the ground  
Scream loud, let your voice resound  
This is the place where we stand our ground  

Stick to your guns  
Stick to your guns  
Stick to your guns  
Stick to your guns  

Through the fire, through the flames  
We will rise again  
This is more than a warning  
This is war  

Stick to your guns  
Stick to your guns  
Stick to your guns  
Stick to your guns
