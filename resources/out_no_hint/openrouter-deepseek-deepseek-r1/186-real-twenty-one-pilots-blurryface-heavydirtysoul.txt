Death inspires me like a dog inspires a rabbit  
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?  
You’re an angel  
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?  
I’m a chemical  
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?  

This is not a rap, this is not a hip-hop song  
This is a ghost town  
My shadow’s the only one that walks beside me  
My shallow heart’s the only thing that’s beating  
Sometimes I wanna disappear  

Can you save my heavy dirty soul?  
For me, for me  
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?  
For me, for me  

Scared of my own image, scared of my own immaturity  
Scared of my own ceiling, scared I’ll die of uncertainty  
Fear might be the death of me, fear leads to anxiety  
Don’t know what’s inside of me  

Can you save my heavy dirty soul?  
For me, for me  
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?  
For me, for me  

Death inspires me like a dog inspires a rabbit  
Death inspires me like a dog inspires a rabbit  
Death inspires me like a dog inspires a rabbit  
Death inspires me like a dog inspires a rabbit
