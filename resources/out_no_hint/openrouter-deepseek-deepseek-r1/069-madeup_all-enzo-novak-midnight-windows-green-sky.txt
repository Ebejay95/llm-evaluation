midnight whispers through the glass  
a neon hum where shadows pass  
the city breathes in static hymns  
green sky pulses on the rim  
  
fingers trace the cold divide  
echoes slip to the other side  
static stars in fractured rows  
humming secrets only windows know  
  
hold your breath—the world’s a thread  
torn between what’s said and unsaid  
glass reflects the ache we keep  
where the green sky never sleeps
