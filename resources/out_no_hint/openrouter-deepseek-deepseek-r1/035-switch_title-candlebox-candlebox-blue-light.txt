Blue light, blue light, blue light  
Shinin' down on your face  
Blue light, blue light, blue light  
Shinin' down on your face  

Walkin' down the street tonight  
I saw you standin' there  
Your eyes were filled with sorrow  
And your heart was filled with care  

Blue light, blue light, blue light  
Shinin' down on your face  
Blue light, blue light, blue light  
Shinin' down on your face  

Man in the window, he don't care  
He just sits and stares  
Woman on the sidewalk  
With a suitcase full of tears  

Blue light, blue light, blue light  
Shinin' down on your face  
Blue light, blue light, blue light  
Shinin' down on your face  

Man with a gun in his hand  
Screamin' at the moon  
Woman with a broken heart  
Singin' out of tune  

Blue light, blue light, blue light  
Shinin' down on your face  
Blue light, blue light, blue light  
Shinin' down on your face  

Blue light, blue light, blue light  
Shinin' down...
