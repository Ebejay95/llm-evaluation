It was me on that road  
But you couldn't see me  
Too much light there, I guess  

It was me, honey  
Beams from your car  
Tried to hush the noise  

But you couldn't hear me  
Coming through your mirrors  
So I tried to call  

All the time wondering  
What else is there?  
What else is there?  

I’m the boy in the riot  
I’m the noise in your static  
I’m the storm coming in  

And after the fire  
After the rain  
When I passed by your window  

You couldn’t see me  
Through the frost on your pane  
So I tried to call  

All the time wondering  
What else is there?  
What else is there?  

What else is there?  
What else is there?  
What else is there?  
What else is there?
