(Intro)  
Let's get physical  
Let's get physical  
Let's get into physical love  

(Verse 1)  
Sex-O Olympic-O  
Sex-O Olympic-O  
Sex-O Olympic-O  
Sex-O Olympic-O  

(Chorus)  
Let's get physical  
Let's get physical  
Let's get into physical love  

(Verse 2)  
Hurdles, pole vaulting  
Freestyle, finger-fucking  
Backstroke, relay  
All night, all day  

(Chorus)  
Let's get physical  
Let's get physical  
Let's get into physical love  

(Bridge)  
Go, go, home team  
Go, go, home team  
Go, go, home team  
Go, go, home team  

(Outro)  
Sex-O Olympic-O  
Sex-O Olympic-O  
Sex-O Olympic-O  
Sex-O Olympic-O
