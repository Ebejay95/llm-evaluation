[Verse 1]  
Walking through the city streets  
A million faces that I meet  
But none can take your place  
I need your love here in my heart  
But now we’re drifting worlds apart  
And time can’t erase  

[Chorus]  
Body and soul  
I’m holding on  
Body and soul  
But the hardest part is letting go  

[Verse 2]  
Memories of days gone by  
When love was strong and you were mine  
Now shadows fill the air  
The echoes of your laughter ring  
But silence is the song I sing  
To emptiness and despair  

[Chorus]  
Body and soul  
I’m holding on  
Body and soul  
But the hardest part is letting go  

[Bridge]  
Every night I close my eyes  
And pray that you’ll be by my side  
But dreams just fade away  
The truth is cold, the truth is clear  
You’re gone and I’m still standing here  
Alone with yesterday  

[Chorus]  
Body and soul  
I’m holding on  
Body and soul  
But the hardest part is letting go  

[Outro]  
Body and soul  
Body and soul  
But the hardest part is letting go…
