**"Maybe Memories" Lyrics:**  
I'm a little bit of loneliness  
A little bit of disregard  
Handful of complaints but I can't help the fact  
That everyone can see these scars  
I am what I want you to want  
What I want you to feel  
But it's like no matter what I do  
I can't convince you to just believe this is real  
So I'll let you go  
I'll let you go  

**"Joyride" Lyrics:**  
So let's take a joyride, joyride  
Put the pedal down, the tires will cry  
Let's take a joyride, joyride  
Burn the streetlights down, the cops can't find us now  
Let's take a joyride, joyride  
Let's take a joyride, joyride
