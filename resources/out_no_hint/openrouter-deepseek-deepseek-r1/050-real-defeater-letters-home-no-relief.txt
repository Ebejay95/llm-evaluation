"Broke down and shaking, I can’t keep still  
These hands won’t stop their trembling  
I’m digging deeper graves to fill  
With every lie I’m telling  

No relief in sight, no solace in the night  
Just the weight of every sin I carry  
Letters home, stained with guilt and shame  
Every word a bullet buried  

I hear their voices in the static  
Echoes of the ones I’ve failed  
A brother’s cry, a mother’s anguish  
In every shadow, I’m assailed  

No rest for the wicked, no peace for the damned  
Just the ghost of every choice I’ve made  
This war inside, it never ends  
A debt I’ll never repay"
