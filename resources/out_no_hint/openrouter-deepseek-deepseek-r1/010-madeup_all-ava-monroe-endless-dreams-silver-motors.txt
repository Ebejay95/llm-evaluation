(Verse 1)  
Midnight highways, neon streams,  
Whispers echo in gasoline.  
Windows down, the radio screams,  
A heart that races with endless dreams.  

(Chorus)  
Silver motors carry us through the night,  
Headlights painting shadows in flight.  
Every mile a story, every spark a scheme,  
We’re chasing horizons in endless dreams.  

(Verse 2)  
Dusty maps and broken seams,  
Horizons blur where the future gleams.  
Foot on the pedal, no stop, no pause,  
Destiny’s written in the rearview’s laws.  

(Chorus)  
Silver motors carry us through the night,  
Headlights painting shadows in flight.  
Every mile a story, every spark a scheme,  
We’re chasing horizons in endless dreams.
