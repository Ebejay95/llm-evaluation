Neon glow on empty streets  
Hollow windows whisper secrets we keep  
Red river runs through the cracks in the concrete  
Echoes of a heartbeat where the shadows meet  

Ghosts of tomorrow in the static haze  
Flicker like a signal lost in the maze  
We paint these walls with borrowed time  
A symphony of silence, fractured rhyme
