Nobody... gonna take my life away  
Nobody... gonna take my pride  
Nobody... gonna break my soul tonight  
Nobody... gonna take my rights  

You come to oppress me, you come to impress me  
But you can’t success me, no, you’ll never rest me  
You come to control me, you come to console me  
But you can’t console me, no, you’ll never hold me  

Nobody gonna take my life away  
Nobody gonna take my pride  
Nobody gonna break my soul tonight  
Nobody gonna take my rights  

You come to direct me, you come to correct me  
But you can’t respect me, no, you’ll never get me  
You come to abuse me, you come to confuse me  
But you can’t refuse me, no, you’ll never use me  

Nobody gonna take my life away  
Nobody gonna take my pride  
Nobody gonna break my soul tonight  
Nobody gonna take my rights  

Babylon system is a vampire  
Sucking the blood of the sufferers  
Babylon system is a vampire  
Falling empire, we’re gonna burn it up  

Nobody gonna take my life away  
Nobody gonna take my pride  
Nobody gonna break my soul tonight  
Nobody gonna take my rights
