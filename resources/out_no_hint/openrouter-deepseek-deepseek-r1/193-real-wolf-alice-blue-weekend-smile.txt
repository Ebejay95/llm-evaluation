Don’t call me kid, don’t call me baby  
Look at me, I’m all grown up  
Don’t tell me to deny the blood  
The blood, the blood, the blood  

I am what I am and I’m good at it  
And you don’t like me, well that isn’t fucking relevant  

I, I am a vision  
I’ll make you listen  
I’m not smiling anymore  

Don’t call me kid, don’t call me baby  
There’s a war inside my head  
I’ll take the leap, you’ll check my receipts  
I’ll make you respect the girl  
The girl, the girl, the girl  

I am what I am and I’m good at it  
And you don’t like me, well that isn’t fucking relevant  

I, I am a vision  
I’ll make you listen  
I’m not smiling anymore  

I’ll take the leap, you’ll check my receipts  
I’ll make you respect the girl  
The girl, the girl, the girl  
I’m not smiling anymore  

I’m not smiling anymore  
I’m not smiling anymore  
I’m not smiling anymore  
I’m not smiling anymore
