In the year 2525  
If man is still alive  
If woman can survive  
They may find  

In the year 3535  
Ain’t gonna need to tell the truth, tell no lies  
Everything you think, do, and say  
Is in the pill you took today  

In the year 4545  
Ain’t gonna need your teeth, won’t need your eyes  
You won’t know a thing when you fall asleep  
Your arms and legs just gotta keep  

In the year 5555  
Your arms hangin’ limp at your sides  
Your legs got nothin’ to do  
Some machine’s doin’ that for you  

In the year 6565  
Ain’t gonna need no husband, won’t need no wife  
You’ll pick your son, pick your daughter too  
From the bottom of a long glass tube  

In the year 7510  
If God’s a-comin’, he oughta make it by then  
Maybe he’ll look around himself and say  
“Guess it’s time for the judgment day”  

In the year 8510  
God is gonna shake his mighty head  
He’ll either say, “I’m pleased where man has been”  
Or tear it down and start again  

In the year 9595  
I’m kinda wonderin’ if man is gonna be alive  
He’s taken everything this old earth can give  
And he ain’t put back nothin’  

Now it’s been ten thousand years  
Man has cried a billion tears  
For what he never knew  
Now man’s reign is through  

But through eternal night  
The twinkling of starlight  
So very far away  
Maybe it’s only yesterday  

In the year 2525  
If man is still alive  
If woman can survive  
They may find
