**Verse 1**  
In the hum of the wires, where the city breathes,  
Stories spark like fireflies in the summer breeze.  
Voices crackle softly through the midnight air,  
A thousand tangled heartbeats, flickering somewhere.  

**Chorus**  
Electric stories, lighting up the night,  
Whispers in the circuits, fading out of sight.  
We’re the broken signals, the static in the song,  
A million fleeting moments where we don’t belong.  

**Verse 2**  
Static in the shadows, echoes in the code,  
Every pixel pulses on the neon road.  
We’re the lost connections, searching for a spark,  
In the digital silence, we leave our mark.  

**Chorus**  
Electric stories, lighting up the night,  
Whispers in the circuits, fading out of sight.  
We’re the broken signals, the static in the song,  
A million fleeting moments where we don’t belong.  

**Bridge**  
Beneath the constellations of a screen’s blue glow,  
We rewrite the endings only we can know.  
Ghosts in the machine, we dance in binary light,  
A symphony of shadows, vanishing by daylight.  

**Outro**  
Electric stories, tangled in the wires,  
Burning bright like embers of forgotten fires.
