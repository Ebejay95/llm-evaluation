Ra  
Feel the weight of the sun  
Burning through the veil  
Echoes of the ancient one  
In the light we sail  

Carve your name in the sand  
Watch the tide reclaim  
Every empire built by man  
Whispers in the flame  

Ra  
Guide us through the night  
Ra  
Turn the dark to light  

Horizon bends, the cycle spins  
Ash to ash, dust to dust  
All begins where all ends  
In the void we trust  

Ra  
The path is forged in fire  
Ra  
The end is our desire
