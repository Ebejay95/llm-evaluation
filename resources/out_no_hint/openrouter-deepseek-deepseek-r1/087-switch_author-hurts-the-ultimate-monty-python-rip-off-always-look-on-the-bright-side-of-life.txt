[Whistling intro]  

Some things in life are bad  
They can really make you mad  
Other things just make you swear and curse  
When you're chewing on life's gristle  
Don't grumble, give a whistle  
And this'll help things turn out for the best...  

And...  

Always look on the bright side of life  
(Whistle)  
Always look on the light side of life  
(Whistle)  

If life seems jolly rotten  
There's something you've forgotten  
And that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing  
When you're feeling in the dumps  
Don't be silly chumps  
Just purse your lips and whistle — that's the thing  

And...  

Always look on the bright side of life  
(Whistle)  
Come on!  
Always look on the bright side of life  
(Whistle)  

For life is quite absurd  
And death's the final word  
You must always face the curtain with a bow  
Forget about your sin  
Give the audience a grin  
Enjoy the show — it's time to go now  

[Spoken:]  
*I mean, what have you got to lose?  
You know, you come from nothing — you're going back to nothing  
What have you lost? Nothing!*  

Always look on the bright side of life…
