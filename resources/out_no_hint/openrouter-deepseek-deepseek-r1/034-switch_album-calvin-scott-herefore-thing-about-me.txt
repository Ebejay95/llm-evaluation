There's a thing about you, baby  
That makes me feel so good  
There's a thing about you, baby  
That I knew I never could  
There's a thing about you, baby  
That makes me feel so right  
There's a thing about you, baby  
That keeps me up at night  

You got that thing about you  
That makes me want to sing  
You got that thing about you  
That makes my heart just ring  
You got that thing about you  
That makes me feel so free  
You got that thing about you  
That's just the thing about me  

There's a thing about you, baby  
That makes my soul ignite  
There's a thing about you, baby  
That turns my wrongs to right  
There's a thing about you, baby  
That lifts me when I'm down  
There's a thing about you, baby  
That turns my life around  

You got that thing about you  
That makes the stars align  
You got that thing about you  
That's always on my mind  
You got that thing about you  
That makes my spirit soar  
You got that thing about you  
That I just can't ignore  

There's a thing about you, baby  
That's written in the stars  
There's a thing about you, baby  
That heals these ancient scars  
There's a thing about you, baby  
That's pure and so divine  
There's a thing about you, baby  
That makes you forever mine
