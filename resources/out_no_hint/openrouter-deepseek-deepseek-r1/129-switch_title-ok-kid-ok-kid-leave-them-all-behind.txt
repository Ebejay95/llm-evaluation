We’re the kids of the lost generation  
Our parents worked their fingers to the bone  
They said we could be anything we wanted  
But all we ever wanted was to go home  

We’re the kids of the information age  
We’ve got the world at our fingertips  
But all we ever do is scroll and swipe  
And all we ever feel is existential  

Leave them all behind, leave them all behind  
Leave them all behind, leave them all behind  

We’re the kids of the lost generation  
Our parents worked their fingers to the bone  
They said we could be anything we wanted  
But all we ever wanted was to go home  

Leave them all behind, leave them all behind  
Leave them all behind, leave them all behind  

We’re the kids of the lost generation  
Our parents worked their fingers to the bone  
They said we could be anything we wanted  
But all we ever wanted was to go home  

Leave them all behind, leave them all behind  
Leave them all behind, leave them all behind
