(Verse 1)  
Walking through the burial ground  
Where the spirits all surround  
They whisper secrets in the night  
Guiding me towards the light  

(Chorus)  
Don’t let your worries bring you down  
We’ll find peace in the burial ground  
Every step, every sound  
I’ve been waiting, waiting for you now  

(Verse 2)  
The fire burns, the smoke ascends  
A message to my distant friends  
The stars above, they shine so bright  
Reflecting in the dead of night  

(Chorus)  
Don’t let your worries bring you down  
We’ll find peace in the burial ground  
Every step, every sound  
I’ve been waiting, waiting for you now  

(Bridge)  
Through the darkness, through the pain  
Love will always still remain  
In the echoes of the past  
We will find our way at last  

(Chorus)  
Don’t let your worries bring you down  
We’ll find peace in the burial ground  
Every step, every sound  
I’ve been waiting, waiting for you now
