I see the shadows on the wall  
They’re dancing in the pale moonlight  
I hear the voices as they call  
They’re whispering in the dead of night  

Take my life, take my soul  
I’m not afraid to lose control  
Take my heart, take my mind  
I’m ready now to cross the line  

Take my life, take it all  
I’m standing here, I’m ready to fall  
Take my love, take my pain  
I’ll never be the same again
