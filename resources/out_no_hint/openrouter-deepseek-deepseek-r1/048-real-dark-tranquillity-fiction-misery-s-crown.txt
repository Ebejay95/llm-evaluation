The hollow vastness calls your name  
A thousand voices drowned in shame  
Aching, quivering vein  
The blood of tomorrow's past  

The siren song of the undone  
The misery's crown  
It shines for none  

The mirror reflects but a shadow of light  
A twisted image severed from time  
Aching, quivering vein  
The blood of tomorrow's past  

The siren song of the undone  
The misery's crown  
It shines for none  

The coldness of winter  
The season of loss  
The withering of beauty  
The burden of trust  

The siren song of the undone  
The misery's crown  
It shines for none  

The siren song of the undone  
The misery's crown  
It shines for none
