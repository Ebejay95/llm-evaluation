I’ve been driving with the trunk wide open  
Hoping something falls out  
Streetlights flicker like a film reel  
Projecting doubt  

I’m stitching up the holes in my conscience  
With thread I found in the glovebox  
Rearview mirrors only show me  
What I’ve lost  

If I keep my eyes on the road  
Maybe I’ll forget where I’m going  
The engine hums a lullaby  
But I’m still not sleeping  

Black and white turns to static  
In the radio’s broken throat  
I let the highway hold my secrets  
While I choke on the smoke
