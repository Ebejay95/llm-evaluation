**Slipknot - "Goodbye"**  
I want to slit your throat and fuck the wound  
I want to push my face in and feel the swoon  
I want to dig inside, find a little bit of me  
'Cause the line gets crossed when you don't come clean  
My wormwood meets your pesticide  
You’ll never get out 'cause you were never alive  
I am the Alpha, the Omega, the cure, and the pain  
The twitching of the thread as the pendulum plays  
All the love in the world could never save you  
Don’t you stand there and fucking cry  
All the love in the world could never save you  
No, the end is here, it’s time to say goodbye  

**Alannah Myles - "Goodbye"**  
Goodbye, it's been a long time comin'  
Goodbye, I'm not the one you're runnin' from  
Goodbye, you can't hold on to the past  
It's over now, goodbye at last  
Goodbye, the tears have all been shed  
Goodbye, there's nothin' more to be said  
Goodbye, I'm turnin' the page  
It's over now, close the book on this stage
