The truth is cold like a razor blade  
A woman’s face in a bowl of blood  
Scorpio rising, the moon is full  
A woman’s hair in a bowl of blood  
Hands around my throat, the truth is cold  
A woman’s face in a bowl of blood  
Hands around my throat, the truth is cold  
Like a razor blade, like a razor blade  
Hands around my throat, the truth is cold  
Like a razor blade, like a razor blade
