[Verse 1]  
We’re dancing on the edge of a knife  
Nothing’s gonna save us, it’s a matter of time  
We’re caught in a web of our own design  
One of us is the killer, and one of us is the crime  

[Chorus]  
One of us is the killer, one of us is the crime  
One of us is the fire, one of us is the fight  
One of us is the liar, one of us is the light  
One of us is the killer, one of us is the knife  

[Verse 2]  
We’re spinning in circles, no end in sight  
Every word’s a weapon, every silence a crime  
The closer we get, the more we collide  
One of us is the hunter, one of us is the prize  

[Chorus]  
One of us is the killer, one of us is the crime  
One of us is the fire, one of us is the fight  
One of us is the liar, one of us is the light  
One of us is the killer, one of us is the knife  

[Bridge]  
Cut through the noise, tear down the walls  
In the end, one of us will fall  
No innocence left, no shadows to hide  
One of us is the killer, one of us is the lie  

[Outro]  
One of us is the killer…  
One of us is the knife…
