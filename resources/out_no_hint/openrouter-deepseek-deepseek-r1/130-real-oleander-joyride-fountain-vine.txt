Heart-shaped face, eyes like the ocean  
Golden cross, blood-red wine  
She’s a queen of the sidewalk, a saint of the streetlight  
A vision, divine  

Oleander, Joyride  
Fountain & Vine  

Johnny’s got a switchblade knife  
A pocket full of trouble and time  
He’s a wolf in the alley, a thief in the shadows  
A devil in plain sight  

Oleander, Joyride  
Fountain & Vine  

Sweet perfume, sweet decay  
Love’s a debt you can never repay  
In the neon glow, where the lost souls go  
We’re dancing on graves tonight  

Oleander, Joyride
