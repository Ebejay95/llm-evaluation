Lucifer rising  
Take me to your fire  
Lucifer rising  
Take me to your fire  

I’ve been waiting for so long  
To hear your voice inside my head  
Now the darkness turns to gold  
And all the lies that I’ve been told  
Are crumbling like ancient stone  

Lucifer rising  
Take me to your fire  
Lucifer rising  
Take me to your fire  

The stars align above us now  
The sacred veil is falling down  
I feel your breath upon my skin  
The ritual is to begin  
The serpent coils within  

Lucifer rising  
Take me to your fire  
Lucifer rising  
Take me to your fire  

No heaven, no hell  
Only this spell we create  
No heaven, no hell  
Only this spell we create  

Lucifer rising  
Take me to your fire  
Lucifer rising  
Take me to your fire
