In the dark, in the dark, in the dark, in the dark  
In the dark, in the dark, in the dark, in the dark  
In the dark, in the dark, in the dark, in the dark  
In the dark, in the dark, in the dark, in the dark  

And you're holding your heart under  
And you're holding your heart under  
And you're holding your heart under  
And you're holding your heart under  

In the dark, in the dark, in the dark, in the dark  
In the dark, in the dark, in the dark, in the dark  
In the dark, in the dark, in the dark, in the dark  
In the dark, in the dark, in the dark, in the dark  

And you're holding your heart under  
And you're holding your heart under  
And you're holding your heart under  
And you're holding your heart under
