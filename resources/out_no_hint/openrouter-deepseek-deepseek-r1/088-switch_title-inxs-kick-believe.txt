[Verse 1]  
Believe in the sound, it's the music that makes you wanna stay  
When the feeling’s alive and the meaning’s so strong, don’t let it slip away  

[Chorus]  
Believe in yourself, just believe, don’t give your heart  
Don’t give your heart away  
Believe in yourself, just believe, don’t give your heart  
Don’t give your heart away  

[Verse 2]  
Take a look at the boy, see the desperate eyes, you know he’s so hypnotized  
He’s holding on, but the moment is gone, don’t let it pass you by  

[Chorus]  
Believe in yourself, just believe, don’t give your heart  
Don’t give your heart away  
Believe in yourself, just believe, don’t give your heart  
Don’t give your heart away  

[Bridge]  
Hold on to the night, don’t let it fade  
Hold on to the night, don’t let it fade away  

[Outro]  
Believe in yourself
