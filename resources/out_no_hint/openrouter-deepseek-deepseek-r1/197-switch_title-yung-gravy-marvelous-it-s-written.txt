[Intro: Yung Gravy]  
Marvelous  

[Verse 1: Yung Gravy]  
Yung Grav, Grav, Grav, Gravy, baby, what's happenin'?  
Prada bucket hat, Gucci slides with the fur, yeah, I'm rappin' in  
I just hit a stain, now my pockets hurt (Ayy)  
My momma think I'm cool, but my daddy think I'm a jerk (Uh)  
I just copped a chain with a big ol' stone (Stone)  
If you talkin' shit, then you sleepin' alone (Alone)  
My bitch bad, she look like a CoverGirl (Uh)  
She like, "Gravy, baby, why you so cold?" (Brr)  

[Chorus: Yung Gravy]  
Marvelous, yeah, my life is gorgeous (Ayy)  
Marvelous, yeah, my momma proud of us (Uh)  
Marvelous, yeah, my daddy doubtin' us (Doubt)  
Marvelous, yeah, I'm feelin' so righteous (Right)  

[Verse 2: Yung Gravy]  
Yung Gravity, pullin' hoes like a magnet (Ayy)  
Got a brand new Jag, I'ma swerve like I'm jaggin' (Skrrt)  
She a messy lil' thing, she a thot, I'ma tag it (Tag)  
She a freak in the sheets, call her Spooky Mac (Boo)  
I just popped a seal, now I'm feelin' relaxed (Relaxed)  
She a model type, yeah, she Instagrammaxed (Flash)  
I just made a mil', now I'm feelin' like Scrooge (Brr)  
I'ma ball on these hoes like I'm playin' for Duke (Swish)  

[Bridge: Yung Gravy]  
Uh, I'm too marvelous for you, baby  
I'm too cold, I'm too icy, maybe  
I'ma sip on this Wock', get lazy  
All these bitches wanna date me  

[Chorus: Yung Gravy]  
Marvelous, yeah, my life is gorgeous (Ayy)  
Marvelous, yeah, my momma proud of us (Uh)  
Marvelous, yeah, my daddy doubtin' us (Doubt)  
Marvelous, yeah, I'm feelin' so righteous (Right)
