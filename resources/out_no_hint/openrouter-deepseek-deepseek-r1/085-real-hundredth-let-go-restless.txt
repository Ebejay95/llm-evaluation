(Verse 1)  
Caught in the undertow  
Eyes shut tight, but I still know  
Every shadow that follows me  
Whispers of what I used to be  

(Chorus)  
Let go, let go  
Of the chains that hold you close  
Let go, let go  
Breathe in the air, let it flow  

(Verse 2)  
Weight of the world in my hands  
Sinking deep in shifting sands  
Fighting currents I can’t see  
Drifting further away from me  

(Chorus)  
Let go, let go  
Of the chains that hold you close  
Let go, let go  
Breathe in the air, let it flow  

(Bridge)  
Waves crash, erase the lines  
Between the past and borrowed time  
Release the grip, surrender free  
Find the calm beneath the sea  

(Outro)  
Let go, let go…
