[Verse]  
Eyes wide open, the truth unfolds  
Shadows whisper, the story told  
Beneath the surface, the cracks begin  
A fragile mind, where do we begin?  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Screams echo in the void of reason  
Fractured thoughts, betraying every season  

[Chorus]  
Deliverance calls from the edge of despair  
Break the chains, ascend through the air  
Perception shattered, illusions fade  
In the wreckage, a new path is made  

[Breakdown]  
Crush the lies, let the chaos reign  
Through the fire, we rise again  
Every scar, a testament to the fight  
In the darkness, we find the light  

[Outro]  
Deliverance… (Deliverance…)  
Perception… (Perception…)  
Breakdown… (Breakdown…)
