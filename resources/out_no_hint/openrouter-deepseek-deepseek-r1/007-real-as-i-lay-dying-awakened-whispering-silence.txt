A voice so quiet, yet resounds within me  
A truth so violent, awakens what sleeps beneath  
The surface of who I thought I was  

This whispering silence  
Is breaking me from the inside  
This whispering silence  
Is breaking me from the inside  

A burden so heavy, it falls away from me  
A purpose empty, now fills where I was weak  
The currents of change are pulling me  

This whispering silence  
Is breaking me from the inside  
This whispering silence  
Is breaking me from the inside  

I will not be led astray  
By the echoes of the past  
I will not be led astray  
By the echoes of the past  

This whispering silence  
Is breaking me from the inside  
This whispering silence  
Is breaking me from the inside
