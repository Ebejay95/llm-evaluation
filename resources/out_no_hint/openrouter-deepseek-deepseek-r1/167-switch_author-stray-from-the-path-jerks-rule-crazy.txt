Bow down to the jerks  
Bow down to the ones who rule  
Bow down to the jerks  
Bow down to the ones who rule  

This is the anthem for the ones who never listen  
The ones who never gave a fuck about your system  
You built this world on hypocrisy and greed  
Now watch it crumble as we plant the fucking seed  

Bow down to the jerks  
Bow down to the ones who rule  
Bow down to the jerks  
Bow down to the ones who rule  

You think you’re untouchable, but we’re coming for your throat  
Your reign of terror ends, this is the final note  
We’ll burn your flags, we’ll tear your walls apart  
This is a revolution straight from the heart  

Bow down to the jerks  
Bow down to the ones who rule  
Bow down to the jerks  
Bow down to the ones who rule  

(You think you’re in control?)  
We’re the chaos you can’t contain  
(You think you’re in control?)  
Your empire’s built on lies and pain  

Bow down!  
Bow down!  
Bow down!  
Bow down!
