I don't need your attitude  
I don't need your social queues  
I'm a punk rocker, it's all I wanna be  
Drink, drank, punk!  
Drink, drank, punk!  
Drink, drank, punk!  
Drink, drank, punk!  

We don't care about your scene  
We don't care about your trends  
We are the ones that you can't stand  
We are the ones with the upper hand  
Anarchy and alcohol  
Sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll  
We are the kids with the X's on our hands  

Drink, drank, punk!  
Drink, drank, punk!  
Drink, drank, punk!  
Drink, drank, punk!  
Drink, drank, punk!  
Drink, drank, punk!  
Drink, drank, punk!  
Drink, drank, punk!
