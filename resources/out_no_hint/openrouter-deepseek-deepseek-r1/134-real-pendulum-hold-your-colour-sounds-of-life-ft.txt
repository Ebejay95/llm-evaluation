I can see the future, but I can't see my past  
Every time I look behind me, there's another memory lost  
But I can feel it coming over me, I feel it in my bones  
The rhythm of a heartbeat drives me into the unknown  

The sounds of life, calling me  
The sounds of life, awakening  
The sounds of life, surrounding me  
The sounds of life, are breaking free  

I can see the answers, but I can't see the truth  
Every time I try to find it, there's another point of view  
But I can feel it coming over me, I feel it in my soul  
The rhythm of a heartbeat drives me out of control  

The sounds of life, calling me  
The sounds of life, awakening  
The sounds of life, surrounding me  
The sounds of life, are breaking free  

The rhythm of a heartbeat, the rhythm of a heartbeat  
The rhythm of a heartbeat drives me into the unknown  

The sounds of life, calling me  
The sounds of life, awakening  
The sounds of life, surrounding me  
The sounds of life, are breaking free
