[Lyrics from "I Am the Night" by Pantera (1985)]  

I am the night, I am the one  
Creeping in shadows when the night has come  
I am the terror, I am the hate  
I am the power, sealing your fate  

Under the cover of darkness, I creep through the night  
Silent assassin, you won’t win the fight  
My eyes burn like fire, my soul black as coal  
I strike without mercy, I claim every soul  

I am the night…  

No one can stop me, no one can see  
The phantom of darkness that I’ve come to be  
I am destruction, I am despair  
I am the end, so you better beware  

[Guitar Solo]  

I am the night…  

Fear me, I’m coming, your time is at hand  
Bow to the ruler of this shadowland  
I am the night…
