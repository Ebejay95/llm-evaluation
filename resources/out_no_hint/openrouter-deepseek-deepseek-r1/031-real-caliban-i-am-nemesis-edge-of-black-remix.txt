[Verse 1]  
This is the edge of black, the point of no return  
A shattered world collapsing, bridges left to burn  
No light, no hope, just shadows crawling deep  
The void is calling, forever lost in sleep  

[Chorus]  
I am Nemesis, the end of all you know  
A reckoning in flesh, a tide of endless woe  
No escape, no mercy, the cycle never breaks  
I am the storm that rages, the fate you can’t outrun  

[Verse 2]  
Echoes of the fallen scream through hollow veins  
A legacy of ruin, chaos unrestrained  
The scars we wear like crowns, a testament to pain  
The edge of black devours, nothing will remain  

[Bridge]  
Bow down to the void, embrace the final night  
No salvation whispers, no dawn to end this fight  
The hourglass is shattered, time bleeds into the sand  
I am the hand that crushes, the shadow you can’t withstand  

[Outro]  
This is the edge of black…  
The edge of black…
