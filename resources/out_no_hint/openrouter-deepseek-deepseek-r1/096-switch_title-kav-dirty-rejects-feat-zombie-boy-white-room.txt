Step into the white room, shadows on the wall  
Whispers in the darkness, echoes down the hall  
We’re the dirty rejects, tearing up the script  
Burning through the pages, leaving nothing clipped  

Zombie Boy creeping, stitches in his smile  
Graveyard chic, he’s been dead a while  
Screams like gasoline, ignites the night  
We’re the phantom army, born to rewrite  

Chrome hearts bleeding, razors in the rhyme  
We don’t need no savior, we’re the end of time  
Break the glass ceiling, let the chaos through  
White room’s bleeding, painting skies askew  

(We’re the dirty rejects, dirty rejects!)  
Rotting roses in our teeth, we bite the hand that feeds  
Zombie Boy’s anthem, a dirge for broken dreams  
White room collapsing, as the anthem screams…
