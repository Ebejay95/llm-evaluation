I was born in the arms of a desperate man  
Raised by a woman with a Bible in her hand  
We grew up in the shadow of a steeple  
Where the preacher laid his laws on all the people  

Oh, the avenues are calling out my name  
But I don’t feel the same  
Oh, the avenues are calling out my name  
But I don’t feel the same  

The preacher said the Devil’s in the whiskey  
Mama cried and poured it down the kitchen sink  
We grew up in the shadow of a steeple  
Where the preacher laid his laws on all the people  

Oh, the avenues are calling out my name  
But I don’t feel the same  
Oh, the avenues are calling out my name  
But I don’t feel the same  

There’s a house on fire down the road  
There’s a liar in the bed I know  
There’s a house on fire down the road  
There’s a liar in the bed I know  

Oh, the avenues are calling out my name  
But I don’t feel the same  
Oh, the avenues are calling out my name  
But I don’t feel the same  
No, I don’t feel the same  
No, I don’t feel the same
