Commander, commander, the orders came down from the donut of power  
Said "We got intel that the key to the cell is in a musical hour"  
So they ordered an air strike of sound waves to flatten the compound  
But the rebels had set up a surround sound and they couldn't bring it down  

There's a war going on for your mind  
If you're thinking you better watch what you're planting  
Or you'll grow a war going on for your mind  

If you're feeling ambitious  
Go ahead and sign your name on the list  
If you're feeling contagious  
Go ahead and take your seat in the pit  
If you're feeling ambitious  
Go ahead and sign your name on the list  
If you're feeling contagious  
Go ahead and take your seat in the pit

The screen is a weapon, beamed at your sofa  
It's a lens to act on your will like a sofa  
It's a flat world, a map of the globe  
Unfold it and lay it over your hole  
Then they fill it with fear, let it rain let it pour  
Let it flood let it swallow the homes on the shore  
Then they sell you a boat and they sell you a rope  
And they say "Hurry up, 'cause the water's still rising"  

If you're feeling ambitious  
Go ahead and sign your name on the list  
If you're feeling contagious  
Go ahead and take your seat in the pit

The war is a test, it's a pop quiz  
The answer is "D" for "All of the above"
