Since I was young  
I've tasted sorrow on my tongue  
And this love will run  
From my mouth and on and on  

Need to feel your arms  
Need to feel your charms  
Need to feel your arms  
Need to feel your charms  

I'm a sucker for your charms  
Need to feel your arms  
Need to feel your charms  
Need to feel your arms  

Need to feel your arms  
Need to feel your charms  
Need to feel your arms  
Need to feel your charms  

I'm a mess, I'm a wrecker  
What's the matter, little sucker?  
Now I'm crippled, I'm a coward  
What do you want from me?  

I don't care if you don't mind  
I can't leave those thoughts behind  
I can't hide, I can't fight  
I need you here tonight  

Need to feel your arms  
Need to feel your charms  
Need to feel your arms  
Need to feel your charms  

Need to feel your arms  
Need to feel your charms  
Need to feel your arms  
Need to feel your charms
