(Verse 1)  
A thousand voices fill the air,  
But none will speak the words I need.  
A hollow promise, a fractured creed,  
The silence grows, a weight to bear.  

(Chorus)  
For broken words, we stand in line,  
Echoes fading with the tide.  
A language lost, a severed sign,  
The void where meaning used to reside.  

(Verse 2)  
Flicker of memories, half-defined,  
A whispered truth we can’t reclaim.  
The shadows dance, devoid of flame,  
A requiem for the undefined.  

(Chorus)  
For broken words, we stand in line,  
Echoes fading with the tide.  
A language lost, a severed sign,  
The void where meaning used to reside.  

(Bridge)  
Trace the scars of what was said,  
In fragments of a dying light.  
The syntax of our endless night,  
A script undone, forever bled.  

(Outro)  
Silent cries in static hum,  
The lexicon of all we’ve become.
