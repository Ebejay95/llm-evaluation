(Verse 1)  
I’m the man in the box, buried alive in the lies they feed  
Invisible chains, institutional names, designed to make me bleed  
They build the walls high, then ask why I can’t breathe  
Got the weight of the world, but I still plant the seed  

(Chorus)  
Man in the box, tryna break the locks  
Eyes on the prize, but the clock never stops  
They wanna see me fall, but I stand tall  
Man in the box, but I’m tearing down the walls  

(Verse 2)  
They told me, "Know your place," tried to erase my face  
But every scar’s a badge, every wound’s a sacred space  
I write my truth in blood, turn the pain into a flood  
From the gutter to the sky, transform the mud into love  

(Bridge)  
They say freedom’s just a word, but I’ve seen it in the dirt  
In the cracks where the light gets through, where the broken find worth  
Every scream, every cry, every soul they deny  
We rise like the sun, refuse to let the fire die  

(Outro)  
Man in the box, but the key’s in my hand  
Rewrite the story, rebuild the land  
They can’t hold me, I’m breaking the locks  
From the man in the box to the stone in the clock.
