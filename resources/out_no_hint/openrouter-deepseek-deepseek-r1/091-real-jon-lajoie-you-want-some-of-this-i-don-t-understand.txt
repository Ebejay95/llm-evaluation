Yeah, check it out  
I got the swag, I got the flow  
I got the bitches, they all on my dick though  
I got the moves, I got the style  
I got the sexy moustache that drives the ladies wild  

You want some of this?  
You can't handle this  
You ain't got the swag, you ain't got the flow  
You ain't got the moustache, so back the fuck up, ho  

I got the hair, I got the jeans  
I got the swagger of a thousand Denzel Washingtons  
I got the walk, I got the talk  
I got the confidence of a guy who doesn't give a fuck  

You want some of this?  
You can't handle this  
You ain't got the hair, you ain't got the jeans  
You ain't got the swagger, so back the fuck up, please  

I'm the king of the dance floor  
Every time I bust a move, the ladies scream "encore!"  
I'm the best, I'm the greatest  
I'm the only one who can rock a moustache this flawless  

You want some of this?  
You can't handle this  
You ain't got the moves, you ain't got the flair  
You ain't got the moustache, so get the fuck outta here  

(Outro)  
Yeah, that's right  
You can't handle this  
Nobody can handle this  
I'm too much, man  
Too much...
