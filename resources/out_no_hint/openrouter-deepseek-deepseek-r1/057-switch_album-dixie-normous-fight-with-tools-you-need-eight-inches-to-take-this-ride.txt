I couldn't find lyrics for a song titled "You Need Eight Inches (To Take This Ride)" by Dixie Normous or associated with an album called *Fight With Tools* in my database. The title may be a parody, unreleased, or referencing niche/underground content. Let me know if you have additional details to clarify!
