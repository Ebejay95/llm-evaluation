The sun don't shine here anymore  
Just ashes fallin' through the floor  
The cracks in the walls whisper your name  
But the ghosts donâ€™t play the same old games  

Hope leaves, hope leaves  
Draggin' its feet through the debris  
Hope leaves, hope leaves  
Takin' the light right out of me  

The shadows dance upon the wall  
A hollow laugh, a curtain call  
The clock ticks backwards, lost its mind  
Memories rust, left far behind  

Hope leaves, hope leaves  
Draggin' its feet through the debris  
Hope leaves, hope leaves  
Takin' the light right out of me  

In the silence, I hear the echoes  
Of every promise that broke slow  
A faded photograph, a stolen rhyme  
Hope packed its bags a long time ago  

Hope leaves, hope leaves  
Draggin' its feet through the debris  
Hope leaves, hope leaves  
Takin' the light right out of me  
Out of me
