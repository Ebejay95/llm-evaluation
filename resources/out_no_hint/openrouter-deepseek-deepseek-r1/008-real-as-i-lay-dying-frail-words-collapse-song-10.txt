Forever, you'll always be  
A part of me, forever you'll always be  
Even though I have to say goodbye  
Your love will never die  
You'll forever be in my life  

No matter how much time goes by  
You'll always be by my side  
Even though you're gone  
Your spirit will carry on  
You'll forever be in my life  

Memories will never fade  
In my heart, they're engraved  
Every moment we shared  
Shows how much you cared  
You'll forever be in my life  

Though I can't see your face  
I feel your warm embrace  
Guiding me through the night  
Being my eternal light  
You'll forever be in my life
