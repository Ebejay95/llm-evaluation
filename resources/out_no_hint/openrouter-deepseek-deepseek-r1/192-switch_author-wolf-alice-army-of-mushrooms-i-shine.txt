The song "Army of Mushrooms" by Wolf Alice does not exist in their discography. However, here are the lyrics to **"I Shine"** by Wolf Alice:  

*(Note: If you meant a different song or artist, please clarify.)*  

---  
**I Shine**  
I shine, not for you  
But because of you  
I’m alive, not for you  
But because of you  

I’m a light in the dark  
But I’m dark in the light  
I’m a child of the stars  
But I’m grounded in fright  

I shine...
