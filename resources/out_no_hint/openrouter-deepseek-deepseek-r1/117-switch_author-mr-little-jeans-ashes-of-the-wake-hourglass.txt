[Verse 1]  
Time is slipping through my hands  
Like the sand in an hourglass  
Every moment, every grain  
Falling faster than the last  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Can’t hold on, can’t let go  
Caught between the highs and lows  
Chasing shadows in the dark  
Trying to find a single spark  

[Chorus]  
Oh, the hourglass is turning  
All the bridges, they are burning  
In the ashes of the wake  
Every step I take’s a mistake  
Oh, the hourglass is turning  

[Verse 2]  
Echoes whisper in the night  
Ghosts of futures left behind  
Fragile threads begin to fray  
Pull me closer, push away  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Can’t hold on, can’t let go  
Caught between the highs and lows  
Chasing shadows in the dark  
Trying to find a single spark  

[Chorus]  
Oh, the hourglass is turning  
All the bridges, they are burning  
In the ashes of the wake  
Every step I take’s a mistake  
Oh, the hourglass is turning  

[Bridge]  
Fading light, the end in sight  
Silent screams, a losing fight  
All we are is dust and stars  
Crumbling in these broken hearts  

[Chorus]  
Oh, the hourglass is turning  
All the bridges, they are burning  
In the ashes of the wake  
Every step I take’s a mistake  
Oh, the hourglass is turning
