(Spoken)  
Wait, wait, wait, wait… hold on. Let me start over.  

(Sung)  
There’s a burial ground not too far from here  
Where the dead come a-creeping out this time of year  
They’re hungry for flesh, they’re thirsty for blood  
They’re coming to get you, so you’d better run, bud  

They’re coming to eat your brains  
They’re not fussy, they’ll eat your intestines  
They’re coming to eat your brains  
And they’ll do it in the creepiest way  

It’s the burial ground (burial ground)  
Where the dead come around (dead come around)  
It’s the burial ground (burial ground)  
And they’re all… in… town…  

There’s a burial ground, and it’s filling up quick  
With the victims of a zombie-fied crucifix  
They’re missing their eyes, they’re dragging their feet  
They’re decomposing to the disco beat  

They’re coming to eat your brains  
They’ll eat your mom, they’ll eat your dad next  
They’re coming to eat your brains  
And they’ll do it while wearing plaid pants  

It’s the burial ground (burial ground)  
Where the dead come around (dead come around)  
It’s the burial ground (burial ground)  
And they’re all… in… town…  

My girlfriend was bit by a zombie last night  
Now she’s craving my body, and I think that’s alright  
She’s got one glass eye and a face like a bruise  
But she still lets me do it to her any way I choose  

They’re coming to eat your brains  
They’ll eat your ears, they’ll eat your elbows  
They’re coming to eat your brains  
And they’ll do it while singing the blues  

It’s the burial ground (burial ground)  
Where the dead come around (dead come around)  
It’s the burial ground (burial ground)  
And they’re all… in… town…  

(Spoken)  
Wait, wait, wait… hold on. Let me start over.
