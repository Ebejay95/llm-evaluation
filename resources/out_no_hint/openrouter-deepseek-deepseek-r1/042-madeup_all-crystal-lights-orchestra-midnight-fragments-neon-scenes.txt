Midnight fragments, neon scenes,  
Flicker softly through my dreams.  
Electric shadows, colors bright,  
Dancing in the silent night.  

Whispers of a past romance,  
Glowing signs in every glance.  
Lost in the rhythm, the city’s beat,  
Where the echoes and the memories meet.  

Crystal lights, they guide me home,  
Through the streets where I once roamed.  
Fragments of a time gone by,  
Underneath the starlit sky.  

Neon scenes in every frame,  
Calling out my lover’s name.  
Midnight fragments, hold me near,  
In the glow, you disappear.
