(Verse 1)  
Neon rivers bleed through the night,  
Electric whispers hum in the sky.  
Jade-lit shadows dance on the street,  
A hologram heart we’re trying to beat.  

(Chorus)  
Emerald dreams, where the futures collide,  
We’re lost in the glow of the city’s high tide.  
Flicker like stars in a binary stream,  
Chasing the echoes of a machine’s silent scream.  

(Verse 2)  
Glass towers sway to a datastorm’s tune,  
Your eyes like circuits under the moon.  
We code our love in a fractured byte,  
A glitch in the system, a fleeting respite.  

(Chorus)  
Emerald dreams, where the futures collide,  
We’re lost in the glow of the city’s high tide.  
Flicker like stars in a binary stream,  
Chasing the echoes of a machine’s silent scream.  

(Bridge)  
Static kisses, a signal decays,  
Our memories pixelate into gray.  
But the mainframe can’t steal what it can’t define—  
A spark in the chaos, a love out of time.  

(Outro)  
Emerald dreams, we’re just ghosts in the wire,  
Burning so bright, we’ll never expire.  
The grid may forget, but the neon still gleams—  
Forever alive in these emerald dreams.
