Underneath the black sky  
Your lies are worthless  
Underneath the black sky  
Your greed is worthless  
Underneath the black sky  
Your corruption is worthless  

The sky is black  
The air tastes bad  
The water's dead  
What can I add?  

Underneath the black sky  
Your lies are worthless  
Underneath the black sky  
Your greed is worthless  
Underneath the black sky  
Your corruption is worthless  

Black sky  
Black sky  
Black sky  
Black sky
