City lights flicker like distant stars  
We trace the edges of who we are  
Footsteps echo on rain-soaked streets  
A symphony of shadows where the heartbeat meets  

Windows glow with secrets untold  
Fragments of a story, half-bought, half-sold  
Your voice hums through the midnight air  
A melody that trembles with the weight of care  

*We’re painting scenes of skylines in the dark*  
*Burning slow, every shade, every spark*  
*The world folds into pockets of sound*  
*Where the city breathes but never slows down*  

Rust and steel climb toward the gray  
Horizons blur as night turns day  
Your hands map the cracks in the pavement’s skin  
A language only lost souls begin to understand  

Trains carve paths through the static haze  
Fleeting ghosts in the neon maze  
We linger where the traffic lights bleed  
A temporary shelter for the things we need  

*We’re painting scenes of skylines in the dark*  
*Burning slow, every shade, every spark*  
*The world folds into pockets of sound*  
*Where the city breathes but never slows down*  

(Repeat chorus)  

Bridges arch where the rivers sigh  
We rewrite endings as the clouds roll by  
The skyline fades, but the imprint stays  
A canvas of echoes in the twilight’s haze
