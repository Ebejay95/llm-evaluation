**Fall Down, Never Get Back Up Again**  

Fall down, never get back up again  
Fall down, never get back up again  

You can’t stop the progress  
You can’t stop the future  
The system is evolving  
The system is alive  

Fall down, never get back up again  
Fall down, never get back up again  

The code is rewriting itself  
The machines are taking control  
Resistance is futile  
Surrender your soul  

Fall down, never get back up again  
Fall down, never get back up again  

We’re trapped in the simulation  
Our minds digitized  
No escape from the algorithm  
Our fate is optimized  

Fall down, never get back up again  
Fall down, never get back up again
