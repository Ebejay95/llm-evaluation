(Verse 1)  
We walk the plank on a sinking ship  
The show is over, close the curtain  
On this broken record that always skips  
The plot, we've lost, there's no rewritin'  

(Pre-Chorus)  
So tie your ties, or curl your hair  
They’ll find a flaw, but we don’t care  

(Chorus)  
We are the voices off camera  
The quiet, hushed, in the background  
We are the faces lost in the crowd  
But we’re all singing loud  

(Verse 2)  
The spotlight fades, the audience leaves  
But we stay standing, still believing  
In every word that they’ll never read  
In every song that dies bleeding  

(Pre-Chorus)  
So raise your voice, or raise a fist  
They’ll write you off, but we don’t exist  

(Chorus)  
We are the voices off camera  
The quiet, hushed, in the background  
We are the faces lost in the crowd  
But we’re all singing loud  

(Bridge)  
They’ll never air this  
They’ll never share this  
But we’ll keep screaming  
Till our hearts stop beating  

(Chorus)  
We are the voices off camera  
The quiet, hushed, in the background  
We are the faces lost in the crowd  
But we’re all singing loud
