[Verse 1]  
The time bomb ticks, the air is thin  
The cracks below are caving in  
The walls are closing, panic sets  
The oxygen is leaving your head  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Left, right, left, right, march!  
Left, right, left, right, march!  

[Chorus]  
Bow down to the, bow down to the  
Bow down to the worker bees  
Bow down to the, bow down to the  
Bow down to the worker bees  

[Verse 2]  
The needle skips, the record spins  
The propaganda’s kicking in  
The static force will make you blind  
And drain the thoughts right out of your mind  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Left, right, left, right, march!  
Left, right, left, right, march!  

[Chorus]  
Bow down to the, bow down to the  
Bow down to the worker bees  
Bow down to the, bow down to the  
Bow down to the worker bees  

[Bridge]  
We march like soldiers to the grave  
We build your coffins, no behave  
The hive is crowding, don’t make a sound  
The swarm is coming to burn your house down  

[Chorus]  
Bow down to the, bow down to the  
Bow down to the worker bees  
Bow down to the, bow down to the  
Bow down to the worker bees
