I can't believe I let you in again  
After all the times you've lied to me  
I can't believe I let you under my skin  
After all the pain you've put in me  

This vice grip on my heart is tearing me apart  
This vice grip on my heart is tearing me apart  

I can't believe I need you like a drug  
Even though you've never done me right  
I can't believe I let you taste my blood  
Even though you've poisoned me inside  

This vice grip on my heart is tearing me apart  
This vice grip on my heart is tearing me apart  

Suffocate me  
I can't breathe  
Suffocate me  
I can't breathe  

This vice grip on my heart is tearing me apart  
This vice grip on my heart is tearing me apart  

Suffocate me  
I can't breathe  
Suffocate me  
I can't breathe  

This vice grip on my heart is tearing me apart  
This vice grip on my heart is tearing me apart
