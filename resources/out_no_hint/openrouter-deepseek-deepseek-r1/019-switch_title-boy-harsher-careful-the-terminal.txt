Careful  
I’m so careful  
Careful  
I’m so careful  

I’m in the dark, I’m in the dark  
You’re in the light, you’re in the light  
I’m on my knees, I’m on my knees  
You’re out of sight, you’re out of sight  

Careful  
I’m so careful  
Careful  
I’m so careful  

I’m in the park, I’m in the park  
You’re on the street, you’re on the street  
I’m in the car, I’m in the car  
You’re in the heat, you’re in the heat  

Careful  
I’m so careful  
Careful  
I’m so careful  
Careful  
I’m so careful  
Careful  
I’m so careful
