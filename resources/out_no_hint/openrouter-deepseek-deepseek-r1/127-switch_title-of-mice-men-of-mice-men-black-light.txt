Black light, black light  
Show me what I’m made of  
Black light, black light  
Show me what I’m made of  

Broken bones and borrowed time  
I’ve been searching for a sign  
In the cracks beneath the surface  
Where the truth and pain collide  

Black light, black light  
Show me what I’m made of  
Black light, black light  
Show me what I’m made of  

I’ve been waiting for the world to cave in  
Waiting for the end to begin  
Burning bridges, breaking chains  
Only echoes still remain  

Black light, black light  
Show me what I’m made of  
Black light, black light  
Show me what I’m made of  

Black light  
Black light  
Black light  
Black light
