there is a place that still remains  
it eats the fear it eats the pain  
the sweetest price he'll negotiate  
the shadow calls and the weak obey  

a line in the sand a drop in the ocean  
a line in the sand a drop in the ocean  

how long will it take for this to go  
how long will it take inside  
how long will it take for this to go  
how long  

there is a truth that never dies  
a mother's tears a lover's sighs  
the more it takes the less it gives  
it costs much more to live than this  

a line in the sand a drop in the ocean  
a line in the sand a drop in the ocean  

how long will it take for this to go  
how long will it take inside  
how long will it take for this to go  
how long  

and the clouds will part and the sky cracks open  
and the earth will shake and the dead will rise  
and the storm will come and the moon will suffer  
and the stars will blacken the sun will die  

and the clouds will part and the sky cracks open  
and the earth will shake and the dead will rise  
and the storm will come and the moon will suffer  
and the stars will blacken the sun will die  

how long will it take for this to go  
how long will it take inside  
how long will it take for this to go  
how long
