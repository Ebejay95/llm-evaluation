There's a war going on for your mind
Media mavens mount surgical strikes from trapper keeper collages and online magazine racks
Cover girl cutouts throw up pop-up ads
Infecting computer networks with SPAM poison
To soften the public for the invasion
To turn private lives into a quick series of
Easy-to-remember phrases
With sponsored links to related merchandise
It's a photo finish, folks
And in the bid for your attention we have an upset
The winner by a nose is
The nose of a celebrity
The rest is a high-budget, low-rent
Peep show for the prurient
Where the right to privacy
Is being sold to the highest bidder
Who'll say anything to get a rise out of you
And those of us content to live with the lie
Are buying into the same old
Tried and true product tie-ins
That keep us in line
And in the end it amounts to nothing more
Than a monumental waste of time
There's a war going on for your mind
There's a war going on for your mind
There's a war going on for your mind
There's a war going on for your mind
