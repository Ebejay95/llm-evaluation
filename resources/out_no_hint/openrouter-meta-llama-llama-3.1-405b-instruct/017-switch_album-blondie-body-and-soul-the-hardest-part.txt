I've been working on a plan
Gonna make myself a man
Gonna make myself strong
Gonna build myself to last
Gonna make myself to be
Gonna make myself free
Gonna make it on my own
Gonna do it on my own

The hardest part of living
Is just getting through the day
The hardest part of moving
Is just packing up your mind
The hardest part of leaving
Is just closing your eyes
The hardest part of loving
Is just knowing when to say goodbye

I've been working on my game
Gonna make myself a name
Gonna make myself proud
Gonna make myself stand tall
Gonna make myself to be
Gonna make myself free
Gonna make it on my own
Gonna do it on my own

The hardest part of living
Is just getting through the day
The hardest part of moving
Is just packing up your mind
The hardest part of leaving
Is just closing your eyes
The hardest part of loving
Is just knowing when to say goodbye

The hardest part of living

The hardest part of moving
Is just packing up your mind
The hardest part of leaving
Is just closing your eyes
The hardest part of loving
Is just knowing when to say goodbye
