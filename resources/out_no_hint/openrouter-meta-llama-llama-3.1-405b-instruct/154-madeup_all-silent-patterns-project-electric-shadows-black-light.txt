Here are the lyrics for "Electric Shadows, Black Light" by Silent Patterns Project:

Electric shadows, black light
In the corners of my mind
Flickering images, a story untold
A tale of love and loss, a heart of gold

In the silence of the night
Whispers echo through the air
Memories of a time gone by
A love so pure, a love so rare

Electric shadows, black light
Dancing on the walls
A symphony of emotions
As the past recalls

In the depths of my soul
A fire burns bright
Fueled by the passion
Of a love that ignites

Electric shadows, black light
Guiding me through the night
A beacon of hope, a shining star
Reminding me of what we are

In the stillness of the night
I feel your presence near
A comforting embrace
A love that conquers fear

Electric shadows, black light
Illuminating the way
A path to redemption
In this game we play

In the quiet of the night
Our hearts beat as one
Two souls intertwined
A love that can't be undone

Electric shadows, black light
A story yet untold
Of a love that transcends time
A love that's pure as gold
