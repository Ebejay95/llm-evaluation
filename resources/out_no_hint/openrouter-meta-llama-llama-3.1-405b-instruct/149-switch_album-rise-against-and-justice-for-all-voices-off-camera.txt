In the operation room, eyes were bright
But something changed, and no one knows why
The surgeon's hand, it started to shake
He looked to the side, but it was too late

The patient's heart, it started to fail
The doctor's brow was beaded with sweat
He knew that he had made a mistake
But with a whisper, he said "Let's just wait"

And justice for all
The words will fade away
And justice for all
The scars will never heal

In the court room, the judge was cold
He looked to the jury and started to speak
"I've heard the testimony of both sides
And now it's time for the final strike"

The jury's voice, it started to crack
They looked to the floor, and then they looked back
"We find the defendant not guilty"
The victim's family started to cry

And justice for all
The words will fade away
And justice for all
The scars will never heal

In the bedroom, the father was drunk
He looked to his wife and started to speak
"I've lost my job, I've lost my way
And now it's time for you to pay"

The mother's eyes, they started to well
She looked to her son, and then she looked to hell
She knew that she had to get out
But with a whisper, she said "Let's just wait"

And justice for all
The words will fade away
And justice for all
The scars will never heal
