For broken words and spent ideals
A fading trust in all things real
The weight of shadowed skies
A lifetime spent on wasted tries
To build a monument of dust
And hope in hopelessness to trust

In the end we're all alone
Walking in the dark, unknown
With every step a closing door
To everything we were before
The echoes of a life undone
A future lost, a past that won't be gone
