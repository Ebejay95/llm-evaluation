I couldn't find "BLOODY STREAM" and "The Perfect Girl" is not by Mareux, however, I found Mareux - The Perfect Girl:

Oh, the perfect girl, she's a mystery
She's got a smile, so divine
She's got a way, to make me shine
She's got the eyes, of an angel
She's got the lips, of a siren
She's got the skin, of a porcelain doll
She's got the hair, of a raven's call
She's the perfect girl, for a perfect sin
