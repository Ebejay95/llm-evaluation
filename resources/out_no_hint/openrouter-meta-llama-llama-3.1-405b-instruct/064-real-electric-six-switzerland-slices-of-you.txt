I see the way you're looking at me
I know what's on your mind it's plain to see
You're thinking 'bout the pieces of my heart
You're wondering which one you'll get from the very start

You want the slices of me, the slices of you
You want the slices of me, the slices of you

I see the way you're looking at me
I know what's on your mind it's plain to see
You're thinking 'bout the pieces of my heart
You're wondering which one you'll get from the very start

You want the slices of me, the slices of you
You want the slices of me, the slices of you
