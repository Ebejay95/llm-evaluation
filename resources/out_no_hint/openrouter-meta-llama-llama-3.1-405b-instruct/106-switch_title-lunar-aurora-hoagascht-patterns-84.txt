The sun sinks down
The shadows grow
The night unfolds
In silvery glow

The moon arises
In eastern skies
And lights the world
With gleaming eyes

The night awakes
The spirits roam
The haunting souls
In moonlit dome

The air is filled
With ghostly sounds
Of whispering winds
And howling hounds

The haunting souls
In moonlit dome
The air is filled
With ghostly sounds
