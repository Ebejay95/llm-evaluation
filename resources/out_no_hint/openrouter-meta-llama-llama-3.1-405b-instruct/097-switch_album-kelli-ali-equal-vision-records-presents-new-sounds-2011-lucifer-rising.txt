In twilight's hush, where shadows play
Amidst the trees, a figure sways
The wind whispers secrets, of a mystic rite
As darkness weaves, a spell tonight

In hollowed eyes, a fire gleams
A phoenix rising, from the ashes' dreams
With every step, a path unwinds
Through labyrinths, of the twisted mind

Oh, Lucifer rising, with wings outstretched
In starry skies, a silhouette etched
A fallen angel, with a heart aflame
In endless night, a spirit proclaims

In twilight's hush, where shadows play
Amidst the trees, a figure sways
The wind whispers secrets, of a mystic rite
As darkness weaves, a spell tonight
