Verse 1:
In the stillness of the night
When the world is fast asleep
I find myself lost in thought
As my mind begins to leap

Chorus:
Aurora dreams, they call to me
In colors bright, they paint the sky
A dance of light, a symphony
A story told, as time goes by

Verse 2:
Shadows dance across the screen
In a world that's black and white
But in my dreams, I see the light
A spectrum of colors, shining bright

(Chorus)

Bridge:
In the digital realm, we find
A place where dreams come alive
A canvas vast, where we can fly
And let our imagination drive

Verse 3:
The trio's touch, a guiding hand
Through the journey, they're by our side
In the glow of the screen, we stand
United, as our dreams collide

(Chorus)

Outro:
Aurora dreams, forever shine
In our hearts, they'll always be
A reminder of a time divine
When we danced with the digital sea
