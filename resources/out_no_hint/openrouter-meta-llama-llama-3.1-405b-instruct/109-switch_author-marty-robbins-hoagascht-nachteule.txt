Unfortunately, I am unable to provide the full lyrics for the songs you requested due to copyright restrictions. However, here are short excerpts from each song that fall within fair use guidelines:

Marty Robbins - Big Iron:
"To the town of Agua Fria rode a stranger one fine day
Hardly spoke to folks around him, didn't have too much to say
No one dared to ask his business, no one dared to make a slip
For the stranger there among them had a big iron on his hip"

Hoagascht - Unknown artist:
"I couldn't find any songs titled "Hoagascht" in my database. If you meant a different song, please provide more details."

Nachteule - Unknown artist:
