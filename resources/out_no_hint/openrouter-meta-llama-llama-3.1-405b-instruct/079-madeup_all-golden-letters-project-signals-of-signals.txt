Here are the lyrics for "Signals of Signals" by Golden Letters Project:

Signals of signals, in the night
Transmitting messages, out of sight
Encoded in waves, a secret code
A language only some, can decode

Receiving stations, listen close
To the whispers, of the Morse
Dots and dashes, tell a tale
Of a world, that's up for sale

Signals of signals, in the air
A hidden network, everywhere
Invisible to the naked eye
But to those who know, it's clear as sky

In the static, there's a voice
A message from the ether, a secret noise
Telling stories, of distant lands
And the plans, of shadowy hands

Signals of signals, all around
A web of secrets, to be found
For those who listen, and decode
The messages, the signals show
