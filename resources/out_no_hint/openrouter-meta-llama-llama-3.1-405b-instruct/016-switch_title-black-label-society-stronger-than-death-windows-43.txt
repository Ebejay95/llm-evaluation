The color fading in his eyes
He's a stranger I don't recognize
So far from home, so all alone
In a world of sorrow he's been thrown

He walks the streets of broken dreams
Where nothing's ever what it seems
A lonely man, his hopes have fallen
The voices call him but no one's talking

Can you heal him?
Can you save his soul?
Can you help him?
Find his way back home

The windows of the soul
Are the eyes to the world
The windows of the soul
Are the eyes to the world

The windows of the soul
Are the eyes to the world
The windows of the soul
Are the eyes to the world
