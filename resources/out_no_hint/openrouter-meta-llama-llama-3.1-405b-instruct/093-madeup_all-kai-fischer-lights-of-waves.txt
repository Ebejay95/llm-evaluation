Verse 1:
Lights of waves, they call my name
In the night, it's all the same
I'm lost at sea, can't find my way
In the darkness, I'm led astray

Chorus:
Lights of waves, guide me home
In this ocean, I'm alone
I need your light, to show the way
In the darkness, I've gone astray

Verse 2:
I've been sailing, for far too long
In this ocean, where I don't belong
I need the light, to guide my way
In the darkness, I've gone astray

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:
I'm lost in the night, can't find the day
I need the light, to show the way
In the darkness, I've gone astray
I'm lost in the night, can't find the day

(Repeat Chorus)

Outro:
Lights of waves, they call my name
In the night, it's all the same
I'm lost at sea, can't find my way
In the darkness, I'm led astray
