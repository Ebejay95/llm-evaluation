Hanging by a moment here with you
Forgetting all I'm lacking, completely incomplete
I'll take your words for it, everything you say
And I'll take my time for it, everything you do

'Cause I'm hanging by a moment here with you
There's nothing else to lose
Desperate for changing, starving for truth
I'm closer to where I started, I'm chasing after you

I'm falling even more in love with you
Letting go of all I've held onto
I'm standing here until you make me move
I'm hanging by a moment here with you

Forgetting all I'm lacking, completely incomplete
I'll take your words for it, everything you say
And I'll take my time for it, everything you do

'Cause I'm hanging by a moment here with you
There's nothing else to lose
Desperate for changing, starving for truth
I'm closer to where I started, I'm chasing after you

And I'm closer to where I started, I'm chasing after you
I'm falling even more in love with you
Letting go of all I've held onto
I'm standing here until you make me move
I'm hanging by a moment here with you

I'm hanging by a moment here with you
I'm hanging by a moment here with you
