Here are the lyrics for "Endless Gardens, Skylines #74" by Fading Echoes Collective:

Endless gardens, skylines reaching high
A world of wonder, where dreams never die
In this moment, we'll make it last
Our hearts united, no future, no past

Walking through the gardens hand in hand
A perfect paradise, like no other land
The flowers bloom with colors so bright
A dazzling sight in the warm sunlight

Skylines stretching as far as we can see
Endless possibilities, just you and me
In this place of beauty and of grace
Time seems to slow, leaving not a trace

Endless gardens, where our love can grow
Skylines shining, putting on a show
Together forever, in this perfect place
Our bond eternal, we'll never erase
