Oh, I've been waiting for this day to come
I've been waiting for, I've been waiting for
Oh, I've been waiting for this day to come
I've been waiting for, I've been waiting for

And now the time is finally here
You're right by my side
And I could wait a thousand years
Just to see you smile

Oh, I've been waiting for this day to come
I've been waiting for, I've been waiting for
Oh, I've been waiting for this day to come
I've been waiting for, I've been waiting for

And now the time is finally here
You're right by my side
And I could wait a thousand years
Just to see you smile

Oh, I've been waiting for this day to come
I've been waiting for, I've been waiting for
Oh, I've been waiting for this day to come
I've been waiting for, I've been waiting for
