Testify, my boy, don't go back
You'll be a witness in the end
Testify, my boy, don't go back
You'll be a witness in the end

I've been a witness, witness to the crime
I've seen the bloodshed, the suffering and the lies
I've been a witness, witness to the crime
I've seen the bloodshed, the suffering and the lies

Testify, my boy, don't go back
You'll be a witness in the end
Testify, my boy, don't go back
You'll be a witness in the end

I've been a witness, witness to the crime
I've seen the bloodshed, the suffering and the lies
I've been a witness, witness to the crime
I've seen the bloodshed, the suffering and the lies

Testify, my boy, don't go back
You'll be a witness in the end
Testify, my boy, don't go back
You'll be a witness in the end
