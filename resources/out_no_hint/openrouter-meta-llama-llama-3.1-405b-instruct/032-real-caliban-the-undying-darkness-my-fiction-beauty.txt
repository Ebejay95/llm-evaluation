Here are the lyrics for "My Fiction Beauty" by Caliban from the album "The Undying Darkness":

You are my fiction beauty
A goddess in my dreams
I'm addicted to your smell
I'm addicted to your skin
I'm addicted to the secrets
That you whisper in my ear
Let me be your lover
Let me be the one you fear

My fiction beauty
My fiction beauty

You are my fiction beauty
A demon in disguise
I'm addicted to your lies
I'm addicted to your touch
I'm addicted to the secrets
That we're keeping from each other
Let me be your lover
Let me be the one you trust

My fiction beauty
My fiction beauty

I'm addicted to your smell
I'm addicted to your skin
I'm addicted to the secrets
That you whisper in my ear
Let me be your lover
Let me be the one you fear

My fiction beauty
My fiction beauty
