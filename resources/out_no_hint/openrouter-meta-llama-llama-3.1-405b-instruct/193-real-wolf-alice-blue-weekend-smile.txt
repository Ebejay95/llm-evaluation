When will we get the time to be just friends
It's been too long since we had enough time to spend
I get home and I don't want to talk about it
And nothing's changed, I still get anxious


I feel like I'm losing myself
In the wreckage of it all
When I'm alone with my thoughts is when I feel most calm


When will we get the time to be just friends
It's been too long since we had enough time to spend


I hope I can think of something funny to say
I hope the tension will break
I hope I can stay motivated
And we can stay up late


When will we get the time to be just friends
It's been too long since we had enough time to spend
I get home and I don't want to talk about it
And nothing's changed, I still get anxious


I feel like I'm losing myself
In the wreckage of it all
When I'm alone with my thoughts is when I feel most calm


The smile, the smile, the smile, the smile
The smile, the smile, the smile, the smile


When will we get the time to be just friends
It's been too long since we had enough time to spend
I get home and I don't want to talk about it
And nothing's changed, I still get anxious


The smile, the smile, the smile, the smile
The smile, the smile, the smile, the smile
