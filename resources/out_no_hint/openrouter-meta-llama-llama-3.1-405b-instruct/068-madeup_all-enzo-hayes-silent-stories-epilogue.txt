Here lies the truth, buried deep within
A tale untold, a story to begin
In the silence of the night, whispers echo through the trees
A haunting melody, carried on the breeze

The pages turn, the story unfolds
A journey through the dark, a path unknown
The shadows dance, the moonlight fades
A symphony of secrets, a serenade

In the depths of the forest, a figure stands alone
A guardian of the past, a sentinel of stone
With eyes that pierce the soul, and a voice that shakes the earth
A keeper of the tales, a chronicler of worth

The wind carries the memories, the leaves rustle with the tales
Of heroes and villains, of love and betrayal
A tapestry woven, a mosaic of time
A legacy of the ages, a reason and a rhyme

So listen closely, to the whispers in the air
The stories of the silent, the truths laid bare
For in the quiet moments, when the world seems still
The epilogue is written, and the stories fulfill
