I've been walking down the avenues
Trying to find a better view
Maybe I could understand
The way you turned your back on me

I've been searching through the wandering
Letters that you never sent
Maybe I could find the words
To say I can't forget

And I don't know what I'm doing here
But I'll just keep on moving
And I don't know where the years have gone
But I'll just keep on moving on

I've been thinking about the quiet nights
When the world was just a blur
Maybe I could find the peace
In knowing I was yours

And I don't know what I'm doing here
But I'll just keep on moving
And I don't know where the years have gone
But I'll just keep on moving on

And I don't know what I'm doing here
But I'll just keep on moving
And I don't know where the years have gone
But I'll just keep on moving on
