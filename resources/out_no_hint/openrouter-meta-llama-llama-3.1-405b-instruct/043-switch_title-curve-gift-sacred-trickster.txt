Something made me stop
Something gave me the job
To make you move
To make you get up
Something made me stop
Something gave me the job
To make you move
To make you get up

My head is full of tricks
My bag is full of bricks
I'm looking for a sucker
I'm looking for a trick
Something made me stop
Something gave me the job
To make you move
To make you get up

Sacred trickster
Sacred trickster
Sacred, sacred, sacred, sacred
