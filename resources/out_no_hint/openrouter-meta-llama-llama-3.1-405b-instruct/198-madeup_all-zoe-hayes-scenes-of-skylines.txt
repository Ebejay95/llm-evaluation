Here are the lyrics for "Scenes of Skylines" by Zoe Hayes:

Verse 1:
City lights, they paint the night 
In shades of blue and silver white
A million stories, a million dreams
Each one waiting for their scenes

Chorus:
Scenes of skylines, tales untold 
Lives unfold in the streets below
In every window, in every face
A story lingers in this place

Verse 2:
Concrete jungles, asphalt seas
Guardians of hopes and memories  
Every alley, every street
Echoes with the hearts that beat

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:
And as the sun begins to rise  
The night's last sigh, the morning's prize
A brand new day, a brand new tale
In scenes of skylines, dreams prevail

(Repeat Chorus)

Outro:
Scenes of skylines, dreams set free
In every heart, in you and me
