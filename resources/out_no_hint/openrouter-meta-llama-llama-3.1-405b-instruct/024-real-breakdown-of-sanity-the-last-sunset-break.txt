Here I am, standing all alone
In the darkness, in the cold
I can't see, I can't feel
I can't hear, I can't deal
With the pressure of the world
On my shoulders, it's so cold
I can't breathe, I can't speak
I can't think, I'm so weak
In the darkness, in the cold
I'm so lost, I'm so alone
I can't find my way back home
I'm so cold, I'm so alone
In the darkness, in the cold
I can't see, I can't feel
I can't hear, I can't deal
With the pressure of the world
On my shoulders, it's so cold
I can't breathe, I can't speak
I can't think, I'm so weak
In the darkness, in the cold
I'm so lost, I'm so alone
I can't find my way back home
I'm so cold, I'm so alone
