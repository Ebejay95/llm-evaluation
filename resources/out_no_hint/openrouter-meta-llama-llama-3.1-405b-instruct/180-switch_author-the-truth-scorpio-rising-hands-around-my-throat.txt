The Truth by Hands Around My Throat:
I'm not the one you think I am
I'm not the one who understands
I'm just a man who's lost his way
I'm just a man who can't be saved

I've been searching for the truth
In every lie I've ever told
I've been searching for the truth
In every lie I've ever sold

I'm not the one you think I am
I'm not the one who understands
I'm just a man who's lost his way
I'm just a man who can't be saved

I've been searching for the truth
In every lie I've ever told
I've been searching for the truth
In every lie I've ever sold

Scorpio Rising by Hands Around My Throat:
I'm not the one you think I am
I'm not the one who understands
I'm just a man who's lost his way
I'm just a man who can't be saved

I've been searching for the truth
In every lie I've ever told
I've been searching for the truth
In every lie I've ever sold

I'm not the one you think I am
I'm not the one who understands
I'm just a man who's lost his way
I'm just a man who can't be saved

I've been searching for the truth
In every lie I've ever told
I've been searching for the truth
In every lie I've ever sold
