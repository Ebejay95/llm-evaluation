Fading horizons, velvet patterns in the sky
Green light, illuminating the night
A symphony of colors, a dance of the divine
Fading horizons, where the ocean meets the sky

Velvet patterns, woven in the twilight
Green light, a beacon in the night
A tapestry of dreams, a vision of delight
Velvet patterns, painting the sky so bright

Fading horizons, velvet patterns in the sky
Green light, guiding us through the night
A masterpiece of nature, a sight for sore eyes
Fading horizons, velvet patterns, green light
