Distance is the boundary 
Fences built around 
Fragile hearts beating 
In a world turned upside down 

The echoes of our silence 
Are the only sound 
Fading light on the horizon 
As the darkness closes in around 

 Distance is the boundary 
Fences built around 
Fragile hearts beating 
In a world turned upside down
