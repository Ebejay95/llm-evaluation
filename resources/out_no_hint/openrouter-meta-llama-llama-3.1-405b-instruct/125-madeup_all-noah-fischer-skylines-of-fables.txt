Verse 1:
I'm walking on the skyline of fables
Where dreams are made and hearts are stable
I see the world through different eyes
A place where truth and lies collide

Chorus:
Skylines of fables, where stories are told
A world of make-believe, where we can be bold
We'll build our castles in the air
And live our lives without a care

Verse 2:
The city lights are shining bright
A beacon in the darkest night
We'll write our names in the stars above
And fill our hearts with endless love

(Chorus)

Bridge:
In this world of fantasy
We'll find our own reality
Where dreams come true and magic happens
And we'll never have to feel abandoned

Verse 3:
So let's escape to the skylines of fables
Where we can be whoever we are able
We'll spread our wings and learn to fly
In a world where we'll never say goodbye

(Chorus)

Outro:
Skylines of fables, where we'll always be
Living our dreams for eternity
