In the shroud of night, I'll find my home
Where the shadows dance upon the wall
A midnight peace, a silent call
Echoes of what will never be the same

Shores I've yet to reach, I'll find my own
In the dark of night, I'll find my home
Where the shadows dance upon the wall
A midnight peace, a silent call

In the silence I hear your voice
Whispers of a summer breeze
Echoes of a love so true
Forever lost, in me, in you

In the shroud of night, I'll find my home
Where the shadows dance upon the wall
A midnight peace, a silent call
Echoes of what will never be the same
