Rag doll, rag doll
Oh, my rag doll blues
Scissors cut my heart in two
Rag doll, rag doll
Oh, my rag doll blues
Scissors cut my heart in two

I'm just a little rag doll
That's all I'll ever be
Torn and tattered, worn and battered
That's my destiny

Rag doll, rag doll
Oh, my rag doll blues
Scissors cut my heart in two
Rag doll, rag doll
Oh, my rag doll blues
Scissors cut my heart in two

I'm just a plaything
For the world to abuse
Stitched together, coming undone
I've got the rag doll blues

Rag doll, rag doll
Oh, my rag doll blues
Scissors cut my heart in two
Rag doll, rag doll
Oh, my rag doll blues
Scissors cut my heart in two
