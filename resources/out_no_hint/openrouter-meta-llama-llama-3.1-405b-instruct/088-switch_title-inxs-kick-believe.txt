I could see the city light
Windswept men with instruments
Who have not eaten for a long time
I could see the look of tension
Prisoners of their own dimension
Like a scream but it's a whisper
I could see the city lights
Windswept men with instruments
Who have not eaten for a long time
I could see the look of tension
Prisoners of their own dimension
Like a scream but it's a whisper
I believe those who can see
I believe to discover
I believe to resist
I believe in recovery
