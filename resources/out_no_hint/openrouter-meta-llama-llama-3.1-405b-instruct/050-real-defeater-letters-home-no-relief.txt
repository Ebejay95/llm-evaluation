I've been trying to find the words
For so long, I've been at a loss
It's like trying to stop the wind
Or hold on to the rain as it falls

And I've been trying to find the time
To sit down and clear my mind
But it's like trying to stop the tide
Or hold on to the waves as they crash

And I know that you're waiting
For a sign or a signal from me
But I'm afraid that I've got nothing left
Nothing left to give

I've been trying to find the words
For so long, I've been at a loss
It's like trying to stop the wind
Or hold on to the rain as it falls

And I've been trying to find the time
To sit down and clear my mind
But it's like trying to stop the tide
Or hold on to the waves as they crash

And I know that you're waiting
For a sign or a signal from me
But I'm afraid that I've got nothing left
Nothing left to give

And I know that you're waiting
For a sign or a signal from me
But I'm afraid that I've got nothing left
Nothing left to give
