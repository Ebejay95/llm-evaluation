Paper skylines, paper skylines
We're building cities in our minds
Paper skylines, paper skylines
We're chasing dreams and leaving signs

In golden rooms we write our stories
In golden rooms we share our glories
In golden rooms we find our truth
In golden rooms we spend our youth

Paper skylines, paper skylines
We're painting colors, drawing lines
Paper skylines, paper skylines
We're breaking borders, feeling fine

In golden rooms we write our stories
In golden rooms we share our glories
In golden rooms we find our truth
In golden rooms we spend our youth

Lights, lights, turning on the lights
Shining in the darkest nights
Lights, lights, turning on the lights
Guiding us through winds and tides

In golden rooms we write our stories
In golden rooms we share our glories
In golden rooms we find our truth
In golden rooms we spend our youth
