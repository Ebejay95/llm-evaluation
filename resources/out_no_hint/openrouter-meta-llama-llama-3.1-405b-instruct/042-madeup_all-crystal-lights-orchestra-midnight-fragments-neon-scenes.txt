Verse 1:
Crystal lights, a symphony
Orchestra of the night
Playing melodies, a mystery
In the silence, we ignite

Chorus:
Midnight fragments, scattered dreams
Neon scenes, a vivid sight
In the darkness, we convene
Lost in the enchantment of the night

Verse 2:
Shadows dance, a silhouette
Moving to the rhythm's beat
Pulsing through the concrete
In the city's endless heat

(Chorus)
Midnight fragments, scattered dreams
Neon scenes, a vivid sight
In the darkness, we convene
Lost in the enchantment of the night

Bridge:
As the stars above us glisten
We surrender to the sound
In this moment, we are living
Where the magic can be found

(Chorus)
Midnight fragments, scattered dreams
Neon scenes, a vivid sight
In the darkness, we convene
Lost in the enchantment of the night
