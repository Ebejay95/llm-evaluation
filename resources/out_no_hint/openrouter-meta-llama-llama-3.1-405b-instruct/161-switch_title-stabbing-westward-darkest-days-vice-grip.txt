Vice Grip by Stabbing Westward, from the album Darkest Days, goes as follows:

I feel you slipping through my vice grip
The tighter I hold on
The more you're ripping apart
I feel you slipping through my vice grip
The tighter I hold on
The more you're ripping apart

I feel you slipping through my vice grip
The tighter I hold on
The more you're ripping apart
I feel you slipping through my vice grip
The tighter I hold on
The more you're ripping apart

I feel you slipping through my vice grip
The tighter I hold on
The more you're ripping apart
I feel you slipping through my vice grip
The tighter I hold on
The more you're ripping apart
