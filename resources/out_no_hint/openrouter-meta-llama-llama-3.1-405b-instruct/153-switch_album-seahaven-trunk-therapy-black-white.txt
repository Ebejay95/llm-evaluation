I'm stuck in neutral, nothing's clear
Black and white, that's all I hear
I'm searching for a light, a guiding light
To lead me through, to make it right

I'm trying to find my place, my purpose too
But everything I do, it just don't feel true
I'm stuck in the haze, of a world that's grey
Where the lines get blurred, and I drift away

In the black and white, I search for the truth
But it's hard to find, when the world is youth
I'm trying to make sense, of the world outside
But it's hard to focus, when the lines divide

I'm stuck in neutral, nothing's clear
Black and white, that's all I hear
I'm searching for a light, a guiding light
To lead me through, to make it right
