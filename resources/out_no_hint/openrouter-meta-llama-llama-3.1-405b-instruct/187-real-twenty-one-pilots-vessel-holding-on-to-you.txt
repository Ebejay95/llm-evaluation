Because the spiders all in tune
The spiders all in tune
The spiders all in tune

I'm holding on to you
'Cause you're holding on to me
It's the way it's gotta be

I'm holding on to you
'Cause you're holding on to me
It's the way it's gotta be

Lean with it 'cause just the other day
There was an evacuation
The shading underneath the tree

I'm holding on to you
'Cause you're holding on to me
It's the way it's gotta be

I'm holding on to you
'Cause you're holding on to me
It's the way it's gotta be

Take the car and drive on over
I'll ride shotgun for you
And we'll blast it loud and sing it proud
But until then I'll just strum this here guitar

I'm holding on to you
'Cause you're holding on to me
It's the way it's gotta be

I'm holding on to you
'Cause you're holding on to me
It's the way it's gotta be
