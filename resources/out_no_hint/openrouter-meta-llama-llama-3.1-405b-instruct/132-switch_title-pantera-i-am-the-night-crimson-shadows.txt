Crimson shadows, I've been here before
The walls are white, passion is calling
I am the night, I am the night
The silence is broken, the spell has been cast
I am the night, I am the night

The mist is rising, the blood is flowing
I am the night, I am the night
The moon is full, the time is right
I am the night, I am the night

Crimson shadows, I've been here before
The walls are white, passion is calling
I am the night, I am the night
The silence is broken, the spell has been cast
I am the night, I am the night

The mist is rising, the blood is flowing
I am the night, I am the night
The moon is full, the time is right
I am the night, I am the night
