Here's the lyrics to "Nobody" by Skindred, from the album "Babylon":

Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody

I'm not the kind of man who'd be givin' you the runaround
I'm not the kind of man who'd be givin' you the runaround
I'm not the kind of man who'd be givin' you the runaround
I'm not the kind of man who'd be givin' you the runaround

I'm not the kind of man who'd be givin' you the runaround
I'm not the kind of man who'd be givin' you the runaround
I'm not the kind of man who'd be givin' you the runaround
I'm not the kind of man who'd be givin' you the runaround

Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody

I'm not the kind of man who'd be givin' you the runaround
I'm not the kind of man who'd be givin' you the runaround
I'm not the kind of man who'd be givin' you the runaround
I'm not the kind of man who'd be givin' you the runaround

I'm not the kind of man who'd be givin' you the runaround
I'm not the kind of man who'd be givin' you the runaround
I'm not the kind of man who'd be givin' you the runaround
I'm not the kind of man who'd be givin' you the runaround

Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
