Waiting for my life to start again
Waiting for the rain to stop
Waiting for the phone to ring
Waiting for the other shoe to drop

Waiting for the sun to shine
Waiting for an old friend
Waiting for a sign
Waiting for this emptiness to end

Waiting for the world to change
Waiting for the break of day
Waiting for an aeroplane
To take me far away

Waiting for the hands of time
To heal the wounds inside
Waiting for the day I'll find
The strength to say goodbye
