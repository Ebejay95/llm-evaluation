I used to know a song by heart 
Before the boys took it apart 
Now it's gone and I'll never know 
The words I knew, the tune I used to go 

I used to know a song so fine 
Before the boys took it in line 
Now it's gone and I'll never know 
The words I knew, the tune I used to go 

I used to know a song by heart 
Before the boys took it apart 
Now it's gone and I'll never know 
The words I knew, the tune I used to go
