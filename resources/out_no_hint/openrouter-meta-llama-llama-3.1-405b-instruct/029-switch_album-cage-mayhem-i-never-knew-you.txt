I never knew you
I thought you were someone else
You changed colors
Like a chameleon

I never knew you
You were an imposter
A fake, a phony
A charlatan

I never knew you
You were a deceiver
A liar, a manipulator
A con artist

I never knew you
You were a wolf in sheep's clothing
A serpent in the garden
A Judas in disguise

I never knew you
You were a stranger
A foreigner, an alien
An intruder

I never knew you
You were a traitor
A backstabber, a betrayer
A turncoat

I never knew you
You were a hypocrite
A pharisee, a whitewashed tomb
A fraud

I never knew you
You were a false prophet
A wolf in sheep's clothing
A serpent in the garden
A Judas in disguise
