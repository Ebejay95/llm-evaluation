The rallying cry of ignorance 
Echoes through the chambers of the damned 
The voice of self-deception 
Whispers sweet nothings in your ear 

The evil empire will prevail 
The evil empire will never fall 
The evil empire will prevail 
The evil empire will never lose its might 

The sheep they will be led to slaughter 
The sheep they will be fed to lions 
The rallying cry of ignorance 
Echoes through the chambers of the damned 

The evil empire will prevail 
The evil empire will never fall 
The evil empire will prevail 
The evil empire will never lose its might
