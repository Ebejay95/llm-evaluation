In the darkness, I'm falling free
No one can hear me, I'm lost at sea
The waves are crashing, I'm losing ground
No safety net to be found

In schwarz, I'm falling free
No one can save me, I've lost the key
The void is calling, I'm slipping through
No way to stop this rendezvous

Falling free, in schwarz, I'm lost in the deep
No way to break this endless sleep
Falling free, in schwarz, I'm lost in the fray
No way to stop this fatal sway

In the darkness, I'm falling free
No one can find me, I've lost the key
The void is calling, I'm losing ground
No safety net to be found

In schwarz, I'm falling free
No one can save me, I'm lost at sea
The waves are crashing, I'm slipping through
No way to stop this rendezvous

Falling free, in schwarz, I'm lost in the deep
No way to break this endless sleep
Falling free, in schwarz, I'm lost in the fray
No way to stop this fatal sway
