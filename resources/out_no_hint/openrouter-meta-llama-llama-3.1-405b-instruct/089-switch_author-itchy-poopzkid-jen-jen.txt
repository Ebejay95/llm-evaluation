Here are the lyrics for the song "Jen, Jen" by Itchy Poopzkid:

Jen, Jen, you're the one I'm thinking of
Jen, Jen, you're the one I'm dreaming of
Jen, Jen, you're the one I'm thinking of
Jen, Jen, you're the one I'm dreaming of

I saw you on the street today
You smiled at me and I walked away
I didn't know what I should do
I didn't know what I should do

Jen, Jen, you're the one I'm thinking of
Jen, Jen, you're the one I'm dreaming of
Jen, Jen, you're the one I'm thinking of
Jen, Jen, you're the one I'm dreaming of

I'm sitting here and thinking of you
I'm dreaming of the things we could do
I didn't know what I should say
I didn't know what I should say

Jen, Jen, you're the one I'm thinking of
Jen, Jen, you're the one I'm dreaming of
Jen, Jen, you're the one I'm thinking of
Jen, Jen, you're the one I'm dreaming of
