Everybody's on the run tonight
A siren's call, then were gone
Into the light, we'll be alright
We'll chase the sun, we'll dance in the night

Everybody's on the run tonight
A siren's call, then were gone
Into the light, we'll be alright
We'll chase the sun, we'll dance in the night

We are the ones, the ones we've been waiting for
We are the ones we've been waiting for
We are the ones, the ones we've been waiting for
We are the ones we've been waiting for
