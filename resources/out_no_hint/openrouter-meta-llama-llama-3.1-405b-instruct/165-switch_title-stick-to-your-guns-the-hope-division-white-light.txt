Here are the lyrics for "The Hope Division" by Stick To Your Guns:

White light, bring me hope
White light, save my soul
White light, guide me home
White light, I'm letting go

The weight of the world is on my shoulders
It's getting harder to lift my head
I'm searching for the truth and I'm getting closer
I won't stop until the world is fed

White light, bring me hope
White light, save my soul
White light, guide me home
White light, I'm letting go

The world is cold, but my heart is warm
I'm here to light the fire and keep it burning
I won't stop until the truth is told
I won't stop until the world is fed

White light, bring me hope
White light, save my soul
White light, guide me home
White light, I'm letting go
