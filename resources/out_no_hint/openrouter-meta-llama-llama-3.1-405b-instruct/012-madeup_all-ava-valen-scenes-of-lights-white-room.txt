White walls surround me
In this empty room
Where I'm left to drown
In my own consuming gloom

Shadows dance on the walls
Memories of the past
Haunting me relentlessly
A fate forever cast

Echoes of laughter
Ring through the air
But when I turn to look
There's no one there

Trapped within these four walls
With no escape in sight
I'm a prisoner of my own mind
In this white room of endless night
