Verse 1:
I've been running from the pain
Trying to escape the rain
But it follows me like a shadow in the night
I've been hiding from my fears
Drowning in my own tears
But they keep coming back, I can't win this fight

Pre-Chorus:
I'm lost in the darkness, can't find my way
Need someone to save me, I'm fading away
I'm broken and shattered, I'm falling apart
Need someone to tame me, to heal my heart

Chorus:
Tame you, tame you, I need you to tame me
Save me from the monsters that are haunting my dreams
Tame you, tame you, I'm begging you please
Set me free from this misery, I'm on my knees

Verse 2:
I've been searching for a light
In this endless sea of night
But the darkness always finds me in the end
I've been fighting for so long
But I'm not that strong
I need someone to help me make amends

Pre-Chorus:
I'm lost in the darkness, can't find my way
Need someone to save me, I'm fading away
I'm broken and shattered, I'm falling apart
Need someone to tame me, to heal my heart

Chorus:
Tame you, tame you, I need you to tame me
Save me from the monsters that are haunting my dreams
Tame you, tame you, I'm begging you please
Set me free from this misery, I'm on my knees

Bridge:
I'm reaching out my hand, I'm reaching for your light
I'm tired of this fight, I'm tired of this plight
I need you to save me, to make me whole again
I'm ready to surrender, to let you in

Chorus:
Tame you, tame you, I need you to tame me
Save me from the monsters that are haunting my dreams
Tame you, tame you, I'm begging you please
Set me free from this misery, I'm on my knees

Outro:
Tame you, tame you, I need you to tame me
Save me from the darkness, set my soul free
Tame you, tame you, I'm begging you please
I'm yours forever, I'm on my knees
