Can't find my place in this world 
I've been searching for so long 
Every door I try is locked 
Every path I take is wrong 

I'm stuck in this endless fight 
I'm chasing the light of day 
But it's lost in the dark of night 
And I'm left with nothing to say 

I'm trying to break the chains 
That bind me to this pain 
But the more I struggle 
The more I remain 

Restless and lost and alone 
I'm trying to find my way back home 
But it's hard to let go 
When the heart is made of stone
