I woke up this mornin' my world crumblin' down 
Reached down to touch it, it wasn't there 
I searched every corner of my apartment 
It wasn't in the drawer, it wasn't on the chair 

I looked high and low, left and right 
It was nowhere to be found, it vanished in the night 
I thought I had it cornered, but it got away 
My detachable penis, it ran off with a lesbian 

Now it's in love, and it doesn't need me 
It's out there makin' good conversation 
It's out there gettin' good penetration 
Makin' some new friends, gettin' invited to parties 

I'm a man without a penis, I'm a man without a friend 
I'm a man with a heart that's full of pain 
I'm a man without a penis, I'm a man without a friend 
I'm a man with a heart that's full of pain 

I woke up this mornin', my world crumblin' down 
Reached down to touch it, it wasn't there 
I thought I had it cornered, but it got away 
My detachable penis, it ran off with a lesbian
