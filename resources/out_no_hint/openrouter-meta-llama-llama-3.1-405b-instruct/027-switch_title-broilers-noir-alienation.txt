Here are the lyrics for "Alienation" by Broilers, from the album "Noir":

Alienation, frustration
In my mind, I'm losing control
Isolation, suffocation 
In a world, so dark and cold

I'm a stranger, in my own life
Can't remember, who I am
Disaffection, disconnection
In a world I don't understand

Alienation, I'm so lost
In the shadows of my mind
Desolation, I'm so tossed
In a world I can't define

I'm a captive, of my own thoughts
Can't escape, this mental jail
Deprivation, of emotions
In a life so bleak and pale
