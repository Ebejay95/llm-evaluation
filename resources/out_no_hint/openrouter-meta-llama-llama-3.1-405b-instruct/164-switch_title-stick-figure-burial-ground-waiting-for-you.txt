I've been waiting for you
In this burial ground
Where the darkness surrounds
And the silence is found

I've been searching for a clue
To unlock the truth I hold
A mystery that's yet untold
In this endless cold

I've been waiting for you
Through the stormy night
Where the shadows take flight
And the winds they howl and whine

I've been reaching for the light
A guiding star up high
To lead me through the dark of night
And into the morning sky
