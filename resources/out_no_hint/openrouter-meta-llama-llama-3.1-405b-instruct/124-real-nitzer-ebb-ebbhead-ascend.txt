Give me the reason to stay
Give me the reason to be
Give me the reason to go on
Give me the reason to stay

I can ascend to the highest point
I can descend to the lowest point
I can make my way through the darkest night
And I can find my way to the other side

Give me the reason to stay
Give me the reason to be
Give me the reason to go on
Give me the reason to stay
