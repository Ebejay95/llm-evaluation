The sun is shining, the world laughs
The children play outside
The birds are singing, the sky is blue
Everything is so wonderful

But then comes the day
When everything changes
The day the world goes down

The children scream, the sky turns red
The sun goes out, the world cries
The birds fall silent, everything is lost
The day the world goes down

The day the world goes down
The day the world goes down
The day the world goes down
The day the world goes down
