Digital shadows dancing in the night
Aurora dreams, they light the sky so bright
Whispering secrets in the wind so light
In the darkness, they ignite

Echoes of the past, in the digital age
Whispers of the future, in the digital rage
Through the screens, we see the light
In the shadows, we find our sight

Aurora dreams, they paint the world in hues
Of neon and silver, in the digital views
Through the noise, we hear the truth
In the silence, we find our youth

Digital shadows, they guide us through the night
Aurora dreams, they light the way so right
In the darkness, we find our might
With the shadows, we take flight

Through the screens, we see the light
In the shadows, we find our sight
Aurora dreams, they paint the world in hues
Of neon and silver, in the digital views
