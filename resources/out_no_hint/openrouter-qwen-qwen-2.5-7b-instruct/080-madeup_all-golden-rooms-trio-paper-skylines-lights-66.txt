Golden rooms where we used to hide
In the shadows of the city wide
Paper skylines, we used to ride
On the wings of our wildest pride

Lights flicker in the distance
Guiding us through the night
In the golden rooms, we find
A moment of pure delight

But the world outside is cold
And the dreams we held so dear
Are now just memories, like
The echoes of a fading cheer

In the golden rooms, we dance
To the rhythm of our hearts
But the paper skylines, they crumble
Like the promises we started

Lights #66, they shine so bright
In the darkest of the night
But they can't keep the shadows
Away from the golden light

In the golden rooms, we find
A moment of pure delight
But the paper skylines, they crumble
Like the promises we started
