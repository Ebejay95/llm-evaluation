I remember the way you used to be
I remember the way you used to be
I remember the way you used to be
I remember the way you used to be

Now you're just a memory in my head
Now you're just a memory in my head
Now you're just a memory in my head
Now you're just a memory in my head

I try to hold on to what we used to be
I try to hold on to what we used to be
I try to hold on to what we used to be
I try to hold on to what we used to be

But you're just a memory in my head
But you're just a memory in my head
But you're just a memory in my head
But you're just a memory in my head

I remember the way you used to be
I remember the way you used to be
I remember the way you used to be
I remember the way you used to be

Now you're just a memory in my head
Now you're just a memory in my head
Now you're just a memory in my head
Now you're just a memory in my head
