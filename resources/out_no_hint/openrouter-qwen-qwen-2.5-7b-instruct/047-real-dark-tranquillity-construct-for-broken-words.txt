In the silence, I find my voice
Echoes of a distant cry
In the shadows, I construct
A world where I can fly

I am the architect of my fate
With every brick, I shape my fate
In the ruins of the past
I find the strength to last

For broken words, I build a wall
To keep the pain at bay
In the darkness, I find my light
A guiding star to guide the night

I am the sculptor of my soul
With every chisel, I mold my whole
In the fragments of the heart
I carve the future, set apart

For broken words, I build a tower
To reach the heavens, to soar
In the silence, I hear the call
To rise above, to never fall

In the shadows, I find my way
With every step, I break the day
In the ruins of the past
I find the strength to last

For broken words, I build a bridge
To cross the rivers, to unite
In the fragments of the heart
I find the strength to fight

For broken words, I build a home
A sanctuary, a place to roam
In the silence, I find my voice
In the shadows, I construct
