Mareux, BLOODY STREAM, The Perfect Girl
I saw her walking down the street
She had the perfect everything
A smile that lit up the night
And I knew right then
That she was the one for me

But she was a perfect stranger
And I was just a boy
I tried to catch her eye
But she just walked on by

I thought about her every day
Wishing she was mine
But she was the perfect girl
And I was just a dream

Mareux, BLOODY STREAM, The Perfect Girl
I saw her standing in the crowd
She had the perfect everything
A voice that sang like a song
And I knew right then
That she was the one for me

But she was a perfect stranger
And I was just a boy
I tried to catch her eye
But she just walked on by

I thought about her every day
Wishing she was mine
But she was the perfect girl
And I was just a dream
