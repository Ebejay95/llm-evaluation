Sunna, 2525
In the year 2525 no one will dare
To venture out of doors
For the sun will have blown up
And the earth will be dark
And the moon will be gone
In the year 2525 no one will dare
To venture out of doors
For the sun will have blown up
And the earth will be dark
And the moon will be gone

In the year 2525 no one will dare
To venture out of doors
For the sun will have blown up
And the earth will be dark
And the moon will be gone
