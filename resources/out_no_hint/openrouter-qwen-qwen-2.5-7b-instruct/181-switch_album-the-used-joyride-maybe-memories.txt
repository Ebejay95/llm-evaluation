I used to think that maybe
Memories were just a lie
But now I know they're real
And they're a part of me
I used to think that maybe
Memories were just a dream
But now I know they're real
And they're a part of me
Maybe memories are just
A part of who we are
Maybe memories are just
A part of who we are
I used to think that maybe
Memories were just a lie
But now I know they're real
And they're a part of me
I used to think that maybe
Memories were just a dream
But now I know they're real
And they're a part of me
Maybe memories are just
A part of who we are
Maybe memories are just
A part of who we are
