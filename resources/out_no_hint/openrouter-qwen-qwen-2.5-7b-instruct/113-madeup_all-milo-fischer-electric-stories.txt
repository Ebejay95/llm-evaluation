I saw your face in a stranger's eyes
I saw your smile in a stranger's lies
I saw your voice in a stranger's sighs
And I knew it was you, I knew it was you

I tried to run, I tried to hide
But your presence was everywhere, everywhere
I tried to fight, I tried to hide
But your touch was everywhere, everywhere

Electric stories, they light me up
Electric stories, they make me new
Electric stories, they set me free
Electric stories, they set me free

I saw your heart in a stranger's chest
I saw your soul in a stranger's rest
I saw your dreams in a stranger's quest
And I knew it was you, I knew it was you

I tried to run, I tried to hide
But your love was everywhere, everywhere
I tried to fight, I tried to hide
But your love was everywhere, everywhere

Electric stories, they light me up
Electric stories, they make me new
Electric stories, they set me free
Electric stories, they set me free
