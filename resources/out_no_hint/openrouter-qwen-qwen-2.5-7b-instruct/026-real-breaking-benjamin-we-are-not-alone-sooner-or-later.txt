Sooner or later
I'll find my way
To where the truth is laid
Sooner or later
I'll find my way
To where the truth is laid

I'm lost in this haze
Of lies and pain
I'm searching for the one
Who'll make it all okay
I'm lost in this haze
Of lies and pain
I'm searching for the one
Who'll make it all okay

Sooner or later
I'll find my way
To where the truth is laid
Sooner or later
I'll find my way
To where the truth is laid

I'm lost in this haze
Of lies and pain
I'm searching for the one
Who'll make it all okay
I'm lost in this haze
Of lies and pain
I'm searching for the one
Who'll make it all okay

Sooner or later
I'll find my way
To where the truth is laid
Sooner or later
I'll find my way
To where the truth is laid
