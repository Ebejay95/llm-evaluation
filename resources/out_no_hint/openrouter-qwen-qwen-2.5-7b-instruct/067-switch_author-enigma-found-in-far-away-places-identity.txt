Found in far away places
Where the sun never graces
A land of shadows and whispers
Where the moon is the only master

In a world of mirrors and lies
Where the truth is but a disguise
I search for my identity
In the echoes of the mystery

Enigma, enigma
A puzzle without a key
Enigma, enigma
In the heart of the night

In a realm of dreams and fears
Where the night is a living sphere
I seek the answers to my soul
In the depths of the unknown whole

Enigma, enigma
A mystery to be solved
Enigma, enigma
In the silence of the world

In the labyrinth of my mind
Where the paths are all aligned
I find my way through the maze
To the heart of the mystery

Enigma, enigma
A journey without a map
Enigma, enigma
In the heart of the night
