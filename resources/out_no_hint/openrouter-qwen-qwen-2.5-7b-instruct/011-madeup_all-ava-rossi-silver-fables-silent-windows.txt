Ava Rossi, Silver Fables, Silent Windows
In the silence of the night
Ava's voice, a silver light
Whispering secrets, soft and bright

In the shadows, where the dreams take flight
Silver Fables, whispered in the night
Ava's voice, a silver light
Whispering secrets, soft and bright

Through the silence, through the night
Ava's voice, a silver light
Whispering secrets, soft and bright

In the silence, where the whispers play
Ava's voice, a silver light
Whispering secrets, soft and bright

In the shadows, where the dreams take flight
Silver Fables, whispered in the night
Ava's voice, a silver light
Whispering secrets, soft and bright
