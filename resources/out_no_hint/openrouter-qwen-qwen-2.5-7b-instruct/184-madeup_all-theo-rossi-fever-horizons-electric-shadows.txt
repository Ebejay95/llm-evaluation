Theo Rossi, Fever Horizons, Electric Shadows
In the heart of the city, where the neon lights ignite
Echoes of a melody, in the shadows of the night
Electric shadows, dancing in the dark
Fever horizons, where the dreams take us to the park

Under the electric sky, where the stars align
Theo Rossi sings, of love and of sin
Electric shadows, whispering sweet lies
Fever horizons, where the heartbeats align

In the fever of the night, where the passions ignite
Theo Rossi, a voice that pierces the night
Electric shadows, in the rhythm of the beat
Fever horizons, where the dreams take flight

Through the electric streets, where the crowds converge
Theo Rossi, a melody that never forgives
Electric shadows, in the shadows of the night
Fever horizons, where the heartbeats unite

In the heart of the city, where the neon lights ignite
Echoes of a melody, in the shadows of the night
Electric shadows, dancing in the dark
Fever horizons, where the dreams take us to the park
