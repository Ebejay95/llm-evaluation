I saw a rag doll on the sidewalk
It had a smile, but no eyes
It looked so sad and lonely
Like a rag doll in the rain

I picked it up, gave it a home
But it still looked so alone
I tried to give it life
With clothes and a name

But it was just a rag doll
A rag doll with a broken heart
A rag doll with no soul
A rag doll with no start

I cut its clothes, cut its hair
Trying to make it look fair
But it was just a rag doll
A rag doll with a broken heart
A rag doll with no soul
A rag doll with no start

I gave it love, I gave it care
But it was just a rag doll
A rag doll with a broken heart
A rag doll with no soul
A rag doll with no start

I threw it out, I left it there
On the sidewalk, in the rain
It was just a rag doll
A rag doll with a broken heart
A rag doll with no soul
A rag doll with no start
