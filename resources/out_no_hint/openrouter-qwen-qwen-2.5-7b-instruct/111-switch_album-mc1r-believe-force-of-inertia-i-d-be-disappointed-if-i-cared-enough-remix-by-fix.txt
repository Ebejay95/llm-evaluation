I'm not sure about the exact lyrics for this specific remix, as the exact content might differ from the original. However, a general version of the lyrics could be something like:

I'm not sure what you're waiting for
I'm not sure what you're hoping for
I'm not sure what you're trying to prove
I'm not sure what you're trying to love

I'm not sure if I should care
I'm not sure if I should share
I'm not sure if I should pretend
I'm not sure if I should pretend

I'm not sure if I should stay
I'm not sure if I should play
I'm not sure if I should run
I'm not sure if I should run

I'm not sure if I should fight
I'm not sure if I should right
I'm not sure if I should hide
I'm not sure if I should hide

I'm not sure if I should break
I'm not sure if I should make
I'm not sure if I should stay
I'm not sure if I should stay
