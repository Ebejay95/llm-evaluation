I am the architect of shadows
Building castles in the air
With every stroke of my pen
I weave dreams into the air

In the city of whispers
Where the nightingale sings
I craft the skyline of fables
Where the moonlight gently clings

Through the glass of forgotten days
I see the patterns of the past
In the labyrinth of the mind
Where the echoes softly last

I am the weaver of tales
In the tapestry of time
With every thread I spin
I create the world of rhyme

In the garden of the heart
Where the roses bloom and fade
I plant the seeds of stories
That bloom in the garden's shade

In the realm of the unseen
Where the spirits softly dance
I am the master of the unseen
Crafting the world of the trance

In the city of the mind
Where the stars are the guides
I am the architect of shadows
Building castles in the air
