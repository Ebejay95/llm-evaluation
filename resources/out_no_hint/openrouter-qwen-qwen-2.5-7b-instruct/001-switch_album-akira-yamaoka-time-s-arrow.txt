Time's Arrow
by Akira Yamaoka

In the shadow of the night
Where the stars are cold and bright
A whisper in the wind
Tells of secrets left behind

Through the darkness, a light
Guiding us through the night
A promise in the dark
That we'll find our way back

Time's arrow, it never stops
Carrying us to the top
Or down to the depths below
In the endless cycle of life and woe

In the silence, a voice
Echoes through the void
A memory, a ghost
Haunting the night, the night

Time's arrow, it never stops
Carrying us to the top
Or down to the depths below
In the endless cycle of life and woe

Through the darkness, a light
Guiding us through the night
A promise in the dark
That we'll find our way back

Time's arrow, it never stops
Carrying us to the top
Or down to the depths below
In the endless cycle of life and woe
