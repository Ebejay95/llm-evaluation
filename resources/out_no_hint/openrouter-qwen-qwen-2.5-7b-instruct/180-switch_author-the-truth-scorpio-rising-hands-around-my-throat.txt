The Truth
I'm not afraid to show my face
I'm not afraid to show my scars
I'm not afraid to show my love
I'm not afraid to show my hate
I'm not afraid to show my dreams
I'm not afraid to show my fears
I'm not afraid to show my soul
I'm not afraid to show my whole
I'm not afraid to show my truth

Scorpio Rising
I am a scorpion, I am a scorpion
I am a scorpion, I am a scorpion
I am a scorpion, I am a scorpion
I am a scorpion, I am a scorpion

Hands Around My Throat
I can't breathe, I can't breathe
I can't breathe, I can't breathe
I can't breathe, I can't breathe
I can't breathe, I can't breathe
I can't breathe, I can't breathe
I can't breathe, I can't breathe
