Midnight Fragments, neon scenes  
In the dark, I find my dreams  
Crystal lights, they guide me through  
Through the night, they light the way  

Echoes of your laughter, in the air  
Whispering secrets, in the dark  
Crystal lights, they keep me near  
In this world, where shadows fear  

Midnight fragments, neon scenes  
In the dark, I find my dreams  
Crystal lights, they guide me through  
Through the night, they light the way  

I'm lost in the glow, of crystal lights  
In the dark, I find my flight  
Midnight fragments, neon scenes  
In the dark, I find my dreams  
Crystal lights, they guide me through  
Through the night, they light the way
