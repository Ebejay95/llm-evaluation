Theo Moreau, Digital Motors, Prelude
In the heart of the city, where the neon lights flicker
A world of secrets, hidden in the shadows
Where the digital minds, they never rest
In the heart of the city, where the neon lights flicker
A symphony of code, a dance of the bits
Where the digital dreams, they never sleep
Theo Moreau, at the center of it all
Guiding the machines, through the digital call
In the heart of the city, where the neon lights flicker
A world of secrets, hidden in the shadows
Where the digital minds, they never rest
