Still corners, pubic fruit, strange pleasures
In the quiet hours, we find our desires
Whispering secrets, hidden in the dark
In the still corners, where the shadows mark

Softly touching, gently teasing
In the strange pleasures, we find release
Lost in the moment, in the pubic fruit
In the quiet hours, we let our hearts clutch

Still corners, pubic fruit, strange pleasures
In the dark of night, we find our treasures
Secrets shared, in the still corners
In the pubic fruit, where desires are born

Softly touching, gently teasing
In the strange pleasures, we find release
Lost in the moment, in the pubic fruit
In the quiet hours, we let our hearts clutch
