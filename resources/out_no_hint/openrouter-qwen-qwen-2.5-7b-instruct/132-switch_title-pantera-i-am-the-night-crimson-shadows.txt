I am the night, I am the hour  
I am the darkness, I am the power  
I am the storm, I am the wind  
I am the night, I am the mind  
I am the night, I am the hour

I am the storm, I am the wind  
I am the night, I am the mind  
I am the night, I am the hour  
I am the darkness, I am the power  
I am the storm, I am the wind  
I am the night, I am the mind  
I am the night, I am the hour  
I am the darkness, I am the power  
I am the storm, I am the wind  
I am the night, I am the mind
