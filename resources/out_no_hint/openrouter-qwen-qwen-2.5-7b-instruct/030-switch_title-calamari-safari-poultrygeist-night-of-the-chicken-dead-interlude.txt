[Interlude]
Now listen up, it's time to rap
I'm bringing you a story that's out of the map
Got a calamaroo on the loose in the sea
And a chicken that's haunting the town, you can't agree
But wait, there's more, it's not just one or the other
It's a tale of two spirits, a calamari safari and a poultrygeist
So hold on tight, it's gonna be a wild ride
From the deep blue sea to the chicken's hide
