I saw a hillbilly moon explosion
In the sky, it was a bop
Happy hour, it's time to rock and roll
Let's bop til we drop, let's bop til we drop

I saw a hillbilly moon explosion
In the sky, it was a bop
Happy hour, it's time to rock and roll
Let's bop til we drop, let's bop til we drop

I saw a hillbilly moon explosion
In the sky, it was a bop
Happy hour, it's time to rock and roll
Let's bop til we drop, let's bop til we drop
