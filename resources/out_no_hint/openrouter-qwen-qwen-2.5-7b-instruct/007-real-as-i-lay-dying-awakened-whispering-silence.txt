Whispering silence fills the air
Echoes of a distant prayer
In the darkness, I find my way
Through the shadows, I'll stay

Awakened from the dreamless sleep
By the touch of your cold, cold keep
Promises broken, hearts deceive
In the silence, I'll believe

Whispering silence, it's a call
To the depths where the truth enthrall
In the darkness, I find my light
In the silence, I'll take flight

Awakened from the nightmare's hold
By the touch of your cold, cold cold
Promises broken, hearts deceive
In the silence, I'll believe

Whispering silence, it's a song
Of a world where the truth belongs
In the darkness, I find my way
In the silence, I'll stay strong
