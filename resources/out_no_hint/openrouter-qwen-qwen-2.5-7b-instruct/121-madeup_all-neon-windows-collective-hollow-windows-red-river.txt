Neon windows shine so bright
Hollow windows, they keep us in the night
Red river flows so deep
Echoes of a love that we can't keep

Neon lights, they dance and sway
Hollow hearts, they hold the day
Red river, it calls our name
In the shadows, where we came

Neon windows, they light the way
Hollow windows, they hide the day
Red river, it washes through
Leaving marks that we can't renew

Neon lights, they flicker low
Hollow hearts, they start to show
Red river, it flows so free
Carrying us, we can't see

Neon windows, they burn so bright
Hollow windows, they keep us tight
Red river, it runs so deep
In the darkness, we find our sleep
