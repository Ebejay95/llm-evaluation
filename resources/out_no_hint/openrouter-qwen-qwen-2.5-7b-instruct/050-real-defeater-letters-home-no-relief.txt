Letters Home, No Relief

I'm just a ghost in the machine
Wandering through the broken dreams
Echoes of a voice, a fading line
In the silence, I find my screams

I'm just a ghost in the machine
Wandering through the broken dreams
Echoes of a voice, a fading line
In the silence, I find my screams

I'm just a ghost in the machine
Wandering through the broken dreams
Echoes of a voice, a fading line
In the silence, I find my screams

I'm just a ghost in the machine
Wandering through the broken dreams
Echoes of a voice, a fading line
In the silence, I find my screams

I'm just a ghost in the machine
Wandering through the broken dreams
Echoes of a voice, a fading line
In the silence, I find my screams

I'm just a ghost in the machine
Wandering through the broken dreams
Echoes of a voice, a fading line
In the silence, I find my screams

I'm just a ghost in the machine
Wandering through the broken dreams
Echoes of a voice, a fading line
In the silence, I find my screams

I'm just a ghost in the machine
Wandering through the broken dreams
Echoes of a voice, a fading line
In the silence, I find my screams
