I am the ghost of what I once was
Wandering through the shadows of my past
Echoes of a life that's slowly faded
Leaving only whispers in the dark

I hold the silence in my hands
A story untold, a secret unshared
In the quiet corners of my mind
Lies the truth, the one that's been concealed

I am the echo of a broken dream
A melody that's lost in the storm
In the silence, I find my voice
Whispering through the night, a ghost's song

I am the silence, the end of the tale
A chapter closed, a chapter erased
In the quiet, I am the last to speak
A whisper in the wind, a ghost's tale
