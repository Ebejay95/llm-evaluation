Hope leaves,  
In the morning light,  
Leaves me here,  
In the cold, dark night.  

I'm a dirty reject,  
Wearing my scars like a badge,  
In this world of the broken,  
I'm just another shade.  

Kav, can you see me now?  
In the shadows, I'm a ghost,  
Wishing for a chance to prove,  
That I'm not just a lost cause.

Kav, can you hear me now?  
In the silence, I'm a voice,  
Wishing for a chance to show,  
That I'm not just a lost cause.
