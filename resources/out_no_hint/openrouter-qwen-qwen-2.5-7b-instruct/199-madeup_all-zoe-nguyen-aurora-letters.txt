I saw your name in lights
Written in the stars
Aurora letters, they spell out your name
In the sky, they dance and they claim
Your name, your name, your name
In the dark, they light the way
To the place where you stay
Aurora letters, they spell out your name
In the sky, they dance and they claim
Your name, your name, your name
I saw your name in neon
On the walls, on the floor
Aurora letters, they spell out your name
In the dark, they light the way
To the place where you stay
Aurora letters, they spell out your name
In the sky, they dance and they claim
Your name, your name, your name
