Sandra, in the heat of the night
I saw you standing there
Sandra, in the heat of the night
You were the only one I cared
Sandra, in the heat of the night
I felt the world come crashing down
Sandra, in the heat of the night
I knew I had to let you know
Sandra, in the heat of the night
I saw you standing there
Sandra, in the heat of the night
You were the only one I cared
Sandra, in the heat of the night
I felt the world come crashing down
Sandra, in the heat of the night
I knew I had to let you know
