Ava Monroe, driving down the road
Endless dreams, under the open sky
Silver motors, spinning round and round
Ava Monroe, feeling alive

Moonlight shining, like a guiding light
Silver motors, in the night
Endless dreams, they never end
Ava Monroe, she's on the run

Silver motors, racing through the rain
Endless dreams, they'll never fade
Ava Monroe, she's got the key
To unlock the doors of fate

Silver motors, spinning round and round
Ava Monroe, feeling alive
Endless dreams, under the open sky
Silver motors, spinning round and round
Ava Monroe, feeling alive
