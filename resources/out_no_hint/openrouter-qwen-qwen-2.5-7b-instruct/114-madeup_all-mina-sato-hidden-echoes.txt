In the quiet of the night
Echoes of your laughter still ignite
Whispers in the wind
Carry memories that I can't unfind

In the shadows of the past
Your smile, a light that never passed
Through the silence, I hear
Your voice, a melody so dear

In the depths of my soul
A longing for what once was whole
Every moment, every breath
Reminds me of you, my dearest

In the labyrinth of time
I search for paths that lead to thine
Through the darkness, I see
Your image, a reflection of me

In the silence, I find
A piece of you, forever intertwined
In the echoes, I hear
Your love, a song that I hold dear
