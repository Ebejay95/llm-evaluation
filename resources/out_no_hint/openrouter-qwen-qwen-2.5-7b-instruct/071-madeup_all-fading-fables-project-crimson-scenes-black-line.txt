Fading fables in crimson scenes
Black line of night and day
Whispering winds of sorrow's dreams
Echoes fade away

Red petals fall from broken dreams
In the shadowed hall
A black line draws the final scene
Of love and all its thrall

Fading fables in crimson scenes
Black line of night and day
Whispering winds of sorrow's dreams
Echoes fade away

In the crimson scenes, we see
The fading of desire
Black line of fate, it does decree
The end of every fire

Fading fables in crimson scenes
Black line of night and day
Whispering winds of sorrow's dreams
Echoes fade away
