Wandering Skylines, Electric Fragments Orchestra, Prelude

Whispering winds through the city's night
Echoes of a distant, forgotten light
Skylines stretch, a canvas of stars
In the quiet, the world starts to mar

Prelude to a journey, far and wide
Through the dreams that we hide
In the shadows, where the heart resides
A symphony of the mind

Electric fragments, dancing in the air
Melodies of the night, they share
Wandering skylines, where the soul does soar
In the silence, where the heart does roar

Prelude to a story, yet to be told
In the whispers of the cold
Of a world that's waiting, to be explored
In the dreams that we hold

Electric fragments, in the dark of night
Whispering secrets, in the light
Wandering skylines, where the heart does fly
In the silence, where the soul does sigh

Prelude to a journey, through the night
In the dreams that we ignite
Wandering skylines, where the heart does light
In the silence, where the soul takes flight
