Neon horizons trio
Emerald dreams we chase
Through the city's endless maze
In the glow of the chase

Electric lights, they dance and flicker
In the night, they never sleep
Guiding us through the darker
Parts of the city we keep

In the heart of the city's pulse
We find our rhythm, our beat
Underneath the neon skies
We're chasing our destiny

Emerald dreams, they light the way
Through the shadows, through the night
In the heart of the city's heart
We find our place, our right

Neon horizons trio
Emerald dreams we chase
Through the city's endless maze
In the glow of the chase
