I'm on a mission to find my way
To a place where I can be myself today
I need a place to let my guard down
Somewhere I can be free from all the sound

I'm on a journey to find my peace
To a place where I can be myself and cease
I need a place where I can be true
Somewhere I can be free from all the view

Galaxy, take me to the place
Where I can be myself and not face
The world and all its pain and strife
Galaxy, take me to the place
Where I can be myself and not face
The world and all its pain and strife

I'm on a mission to find my way
To a place where I can be myself today
I need a place to let my guard down
Somewhere I can be free from all the sound

I'm on a journey to find my peace
To a place where I can be myself and cease
I need a place where I can be true
Somewhere I can be free from all the view

Galaxy, take me to the place
Where I can be myself and not face
The world and all its pain and strife
Galaxy, take me to the place
Where I can be myself and not face
The world and all its pain and strife
