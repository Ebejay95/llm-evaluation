Electric dreams, electric dreams
Echoes in the night, in the night
Electric dreams, electric dreams
Paper waves, paper waves
Drifting through the air, through the air
Electric dreams, electric dreams
Whispering secrets, secrets of the night
Electric dreams, electric dreams
Paper waves, paper waves
Dancing in the breeze, in the breeze
Electric dreams, electric dreams
Paper waves, paper waves
Carry me away, away to the land of dreams
Electric dreams, electric dreams
Paper waves, paper waves
Whispering secrets, secrets of the night
Electric dreams, electric dreams
Paper waves, paper waves
Dancing in the breeze, in the breeze
Electric dreams, electric dreams
Paper waves, paper waves
Carry me away, away to the land of dreams
