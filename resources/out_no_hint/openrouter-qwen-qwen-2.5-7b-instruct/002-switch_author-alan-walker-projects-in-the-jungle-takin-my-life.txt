I'm in a jungle of projects
Trying to find my way out
But the more I try to escape
The deeper I get caught up

I'm losing my grip
On the life I used to know
Every step I take
Leads me further to the void

I'm takin' my life
And I'm takin' it back
I'm takin' my life
And I'm takin' it back

I'm in a jungle of projects
Trying to find my way out
But the more I try to escape
The deeper I get caught up

I'm takin' my life
And I'm takin' it back
I'm takin' my life
And I'm takin' it back

I'm takin' my life
And I'm takin' it back
I'm takin' my life
And I'm takin' it back
