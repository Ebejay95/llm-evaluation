I saw the signals in the sky
Like messages from the gods on high
They whispered secrets in the wind
Told me what I needed to believe

I saw the signals in the night
Like stars that guide me through the fight
They shone so bright, they pierced the dark
Told me what I needed to believe

I saw the signals in the light
Like beacons calling me to fight
They burned so bright, they pierced the night
Told me what I needed to believe

I saw the signals in the fire
Like flames that burn and never tire
They burned so bright, they pierced the fear
Told me what I needed to believe

I saw the signals in the rain
Like tears that fall and never stain
They washed away the pain and shame
Told me what I needed to believe

I saw the signals in the sound
Like echoes calling me around
They whispered secrets in the ground
Told me what I needed to believe

I saw the signals in the dust
Like whispers carried on the gust
They spoke to me in hushed and must
Told me what I needed to believe

I saw the signals in the light
Like beacons calling me to fight
They burned so bright, they pierced the night
Told me what I needed to believe

I saw the signals in the sky
Like messages from the gods on high
They whispered secrets in the wind
Told me what I needed to believe
