Breakdown of Sanity, the last sunset, break
The world is spinning, I'm losing my way
In this chaos, I'm searching for a way
To find my sanity, before it's too late
The last sunset, I'm breaking down, breaking down

In the darkness, I'm searching for a light
To guide me through, the endless night
The last sunset, I'm breaking down, breaking down
I'm losing myself, in this endless dream
The last sunset, I'm breaking down, breaking down

I'm falling apart, in this endless night
The last sunset, I'm breaking down, breaking down
I'm searching for a way, to find my way back
To the sanity, that I once had
The last sunset, I'm breaking down, breaking down
