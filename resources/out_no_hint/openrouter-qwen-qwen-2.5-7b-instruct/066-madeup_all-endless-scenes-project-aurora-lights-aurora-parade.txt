Endless scenes of lights so bright
Aurora lights, they dance in the night
In the sky, a show so grand
Aurora parade, across the land

Through the darkness, they appear
Guiding us, through the night and the fear
Colors swirl, in every hue
Aurora lights, a wondrous view

In the silence, they sing
A melody, of the northern spring
Beneath the moon, they play
Aurora parade, a magical display

Through the storm, they shine
A beacon, in the darkest of time
In the cold, they glow
Aurora lights, a winter's show

In the distance, they fade
But the memory, forever stays
Of the Aurora, in all its might
Aurora parade, a wondrous sight
