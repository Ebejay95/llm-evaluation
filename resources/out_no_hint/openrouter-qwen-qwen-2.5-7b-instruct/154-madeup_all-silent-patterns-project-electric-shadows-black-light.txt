Electric Shadows creeping through the night
Black Light dancing in the light
Whispers in the silence, echoes in the dark
Silent Patterns, they never depart

In the city's glow, a hidden truth
In the shadows, a story to be taught
Electric Shadows, they watch and wait
Black Light, they guide the way to fate

Through the neon, through the haze
Electric Shadows, they make their maze
In the reflection, in the dark
Black Light, they light the spark

Silent Patterns, they weave the thread
Electric Shadows, they keep the speed
Black Light, they lead the way
Silent Patterns, they never stray

In the silence, in the night
Electric Shadows, they never fight
Black Light, they guide the way
Silent Patterns, they never stray
