I'm in this hollow motor  
Got nowhere to go  
In this city of lights  
I'm just a passing show  

I'm chasing skylines three ninety  
But I'm stuck in this dream  
Of a life that I can't seem to find  
In this endless game  

I'm in this hollow motor  
Got nowhere to go  
In this city of lights  
I'm just a passing show  

Chasing skylines three ninety  
But I'm stuck in this dream  
Of a life that I can't seem to find  
In this endless game  

I'm in this hollow motor  
Got nowhere to go  
In this city of lights  
I'm just a passing show  

Chasing skylines three ninety  
But I'm stuck in this dream  
Of a life that I can't seem to find  
In this endless game  

I'm in this hollow motor  
Got nowhere to go

I'm just a passing show  

Chasing skylines three ninety
