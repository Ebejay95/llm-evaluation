I never wanted to be
Just another face in the sea
But I'm drowning in the lies
Of who we are, who we are

I never wanted to be
Just another name in the crowd
But I'm lost in the shadows
Of who we are, who we are

I see the world through these eyes
But I'm not the one you see
I'm just a ghost in the empire
Of who we are, who we are

I'm just a ghost in the empire
Of who we are, who we are

I never wanted to be
Just another name in the crowd
But I'm lost in the shadows
Of who we are, who we are

I'm just a ghost in the empire
Of who we are, who we are

I'm just a ghost in the empire
Of who we are, who we are

I'm just a ghost in the empire
Of who we are, who we are
