Parcels, there is a hell believe me I've seen it
There is a heaven let's keep it a secret
My enemy is a thief, he steals my love
And sells it to the highest bidder
Parcels, there is a hell believe me I've seen it
There is a heaven let's keep it a secret
My enemy is a thief, he steals my love
And sells it to the highest bidder
Parcels, there is a hell believe me I've seen it
There is a heaven let's keep it a secret
My enemy is a thief, he steals my love
And sells it to the highest bidder
