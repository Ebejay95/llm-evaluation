I'm losing touch with what's real
In this world, I can't tell what's surreal
My sanity, it's on the floor
Perception, it's all I can afford

I'm searching for a way to break free
From this prison, I can't see
A light at the end of the tunnel
Or is this just another illusion?

I'm reaching out, but no one's there
In this darkness, I'm just a scare
I need deliverance, I need a sign
To show me the way, to set me right again
