Seahaven, TRUNK THERAPY, Black & White

I'm a black and white kind of man
Living in a colorless world
I see the world in shades of gray
But I know there's more to say

I'm a black and white kind of man
But I'm not afraid to change
I'll take a chance, I'll take a stand
And I'll make a brand new plan

I'm a black and white kind of man
But I'm not afraid to dream
I'll chase my dreams, I'll break the chain
And I'll find my way again

Seahaven, TRUNK THERAPY, Black & White

I'm a black and white kind of man
But I'm not afraid to grow
I'll grow and learn, I'll let it flow
And I'll find my way to know

I'm a black and white kind of man
But I'm not afraid to break
I'll break the mold, I'll break the fake
And I'll find my way to make
