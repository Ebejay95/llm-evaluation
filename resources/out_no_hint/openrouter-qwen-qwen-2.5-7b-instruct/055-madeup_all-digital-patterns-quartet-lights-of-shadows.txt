Echoes of the night, in the digital light
Patterns dance, in the shadows of the mind
Whispers through the wires, in the silence of the code
A symphony of ones and zeros, in the digital mode

Lights of shadows, in the digital dance
A quartet of bytes, in the night's embrace
Through the circuits, we find our way
In the digital patterns, we find our play

Whispers through the wires, in the silence of the code
A symphony of ones and zeros, in the digital mode

In the heart of the machine, we find our truth
A quartet of lights, in the shadows of the night
Through the circuits, we find our way
In the digital patterns, we find our play

Whispers through the wires, in the silence of the code
A symphony of ones and zeros, in the digital mode

In the heart of the machine, we find our truth
A quartet of lights, in the shadows of the night
Through the circuits, we find our way
In the digital patterns, we find our play

Lights of shadows, in the digital dance
A quartet of bytes, in the night's embrace
Through the circuits, we find our way
In the digital patterns, we find our play
