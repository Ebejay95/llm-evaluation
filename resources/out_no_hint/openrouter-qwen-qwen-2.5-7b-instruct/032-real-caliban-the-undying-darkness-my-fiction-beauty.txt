Caliban, the undying darkness  
In the shadows, I am born  
A tale of beauty, a fiction so stark  
In the realm where the night is torn

My fiction beauty, my undying light  
In the silence, I take flight  
A dream that never fades, a ghost in the night  
In the darkness, I am right

Caliban, the undying darkness  
In the whispers, I am heard  
A shadow of a dream, a specter of the word  
In the night, I am revered

My fiction beauty, my undying light  
In the silence, I take flight  
A dream that never fades, a ghost in the night  
In the darkness, I am right

Caliban, the undying darkness  
In the shadows, I am born  
A tale of beauty, a fiction so stark  
In the realm where the night is torn
