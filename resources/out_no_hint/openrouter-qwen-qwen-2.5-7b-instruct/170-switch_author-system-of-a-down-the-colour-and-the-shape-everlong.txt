System of a Down, The Colour and the Shape:
I am the colour and the shape
I am the colour and the shape
I am the colour and the shape
I am the colour and the shape

System of a Down, Everlong:
'Cause we could be heroes, just for a day
Far away from tomorrow
With the colour and the shape
We could be heroes, just for a day
Far away from tomorrow
With the colour and the shape
