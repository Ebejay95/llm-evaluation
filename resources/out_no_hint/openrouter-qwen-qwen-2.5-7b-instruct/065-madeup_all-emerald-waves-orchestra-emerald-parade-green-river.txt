Emerald Waves Orchestra, Emerald Parade, Green River

In the green river, we swim
Under the moon, we climb
Emerald Waves Orchestra, Emerald Parade

We dance in the rain, we laugh in the sun
With the green river, we run
Emerald Waves Orchestra, Emerald Parade

Through the emerald waves, we find our way
To the green river, we play
Emerald Waves Orchestra, Emerald Parade

In the green river, we dream
Of the emerald waves, we scheme
Emerald Waves Orchestra, Emerald Parade

We'll never let go, of this green river flow
With the emerald waves, we'll grow
