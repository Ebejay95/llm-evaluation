Broilers spinning, neon lights shining
Noir city, under the electric sky
Alienation, in every single line
Lost in the crowd, no place to fly

Concrete jungle, where the dreams collide
In the shadows, where the night resides
Broilers, Noir, alienation inside
Echoes of the city, where the heart denies

Broilers, spinning, in the heart of the night
Noir city, where the lost ones take flight
Alienation, in the eyes of the blind
Broilers, Noir, in the city's cold design
