Midnight windows open
To the green sky
I'm floating in the air
Above the city

I can see the stars
Through the glass
They're shining so bright
In the dark

Green sky, green sky
What do you see?
Green sky, green sky
What do you know?

I'm lost in the night
With no direction
But the stars are guiding
Me to a new direction

Green sky, green sky
What do you see?
Green sky, green sky
What do you know?

In the silence of the night
I hear the wind
Whispering secrets
Of the green sky

Green sky, green sky
What do you see?
Green sky, green sky
What do you know?
