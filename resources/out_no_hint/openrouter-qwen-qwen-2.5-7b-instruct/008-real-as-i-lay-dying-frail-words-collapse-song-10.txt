I am the shadow of a dying light
In the remnants of a broken flight
Frail words collapse beneath the weight
Of secrets buried in the night

Echoes of a voice that once did sing
Now lost in the silence, left behind
A hollow shell of what I used to be
In the ruins of a heart that's free

Frail words collapse, they cannot stand
Against the truth that's slowly planned
To tear me apart, to break my soul
In the darkness where my spirit roams

Frail words collapse, they cannot hold
The weight of what I've come to know
That love and hate are but a whisper
In the storm that's raging now
