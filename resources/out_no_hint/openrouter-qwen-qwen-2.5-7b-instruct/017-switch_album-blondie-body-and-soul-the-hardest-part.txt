I saw you standing there
You were the only one I cared
I knew the moment I saw you
That I had to have you

I tried to hide my feelings
But you knew what I was feeling
I tried to run away
But you were everywhere

The hardest part was saying goodbye
When I knew that I had to let you go
I tried to hold on tight
But you were slipping through my fingers

I saw you standing there
You were the only one I cared
I knew the moment I saw you
That I had to have you

I tried to hide my feelings
But you knew what I was feeling
I tried to run away
But you were everywhere

The hardest part was saying goodbye
When I knew that I had to let you go
I tried to hold on tight
But you were slipping through my fingers

I saw you standing there
You were the only one I cared
I knew the moment I saw you
That I had to have you

I tried to hide my feelings
But you knew what I was feeling
I tried to run away
But you were everywhere

The hardest part was saying goodbye
When I knew that I had to let you go
I tried to hold on tight
But you were slipping through my fingers
