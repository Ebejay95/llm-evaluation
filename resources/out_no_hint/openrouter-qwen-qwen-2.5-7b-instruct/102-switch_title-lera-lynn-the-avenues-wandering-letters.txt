Lera Lynn, The Avenues, Wandering Letters
I'm walking down the avenue
Looking for a place to be
Wandering letters, searching for a clue
In this city of dreams and views

I'm searching for a sign
To guide me through the night
Wandering letters, they're my only friend
In this city of lights and sound

I'm walking down the avenue

Wandering letters, they're my only friend
