Kai Rossi, crimson horizons, white sky
Endless journey, under the open sky
Kai Rossi, crimson horizons, white sky
Where the dreams take flight, where the heart can fly

Through the crimson horizons, we find our way
In the white sky, where the stars never fade
Through the crimson horizons, we find our way
In the white sky, where the heart's desire is played

Kai Rossi, crimson horizons, white sky
Beneath the moon, where the shadows lie
Kai Rossi, crimson horizons, white sky
In the silence, where the whispers fly

Through the crimson horizons, we find our way
In the white sky, where the stars never fade
Through the crimson horizons, we find our way
In the white sky, where the heart's desire is played

Kai Rossi, crimson horizons, white sky
Where the dawn breaks, and the night takes flight
Kai Rossi, crimson horizons, white sky
In the light, where the dreams take flight

Through the crimson horizons, we find our way
In the white sky, where the stars never fade
Through the crimson horizons, we find our way
In the white sky, where the heart's desire is played
