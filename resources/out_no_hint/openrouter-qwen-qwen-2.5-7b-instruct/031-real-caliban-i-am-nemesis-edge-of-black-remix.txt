I am the shadow, the darkness in your eyes  
I am the storm, the tempest in the skies  
I am the night, the silence in the cries  
I am the edge, the black of endless nights  

I am the curse, the poison in your veins  
I am the fear, the terror in your dreams  
I am the end, the silence when you grieve  
I am the edge, the black of endless nights  

Caliban, I am Nemesis, the one who brings the night  
Caliban, I am Nemesis, the one who ends the light  
I am the shadow, the darkness in your eyes  
I am the edge, the black of endless nights  

I am the curse, the poison in your veins  
I am the fear, the terror in your dreams  
I am the end, the silence when you grieve  
I am the edge, the black of endless nights  

I am the shadow, the darkness in your eyes  
I am the edge, the black of endless nights
