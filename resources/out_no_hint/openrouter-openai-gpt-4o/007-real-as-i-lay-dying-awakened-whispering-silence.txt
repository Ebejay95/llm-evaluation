Whispering silence, a world without end  
The moment we pause is a life to expend  
The light of the dawn, the darkness of night  
The heart of the lost, the soul of the fight  

In whispers of silence, we find our way  
Through shadows and echoes, we learn to stay  
The whispers of silence, the stories untold  
In the quiet of night, our truths unfold  

Through whispers of silence, we hear the call  
In the stillness of night, we rise or fall  
The whispers of silence, a journey within  
In the echoes of time, our lives begin  

In whispers of silence, we find our way  
Through shadows and echoes, we learn to stay  
The whispers of silence, the stories untold  
In the quiet of night, our truths unfold  

Through whispers of silence, we hear the call  
In the stillness of night, we rise or fall  
The whispers of silence, a journey within  
In the echoes of time, our lives begin
