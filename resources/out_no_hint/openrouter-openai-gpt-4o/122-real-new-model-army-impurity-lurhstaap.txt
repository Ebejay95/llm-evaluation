The sun is going down on the western shore  
The wind is blowing hard  
The waves are pounding the hull  
The sails are full and taut  
The sea is dark and cold  
And the sky is red and gold  

The captain stands on the bridge  
And he looks out to the sea  
He knows the journey's end  
And he knows what lies ahead  
The crew is tired and worn  
But they know they must go on  

The ship is heading home  
To the land they left behind  
To the place where they belong  
To the place they call their own  
The journey's been so long  
But the end is now in sight
