Here they come, the worker bees,  
Lining up on the dirty streets,  
Walking unaware of the disease,  
Spreading from the mouth of the queen.  

The land of the free,  
The home of the brave,  
The heart of the greed,  
In a world that's enslaved.  

The land of the free,  
The home of the brave,

They'll take your money,  
And they'll take your health,  
They'll take your freedom,  
And they'll take your wealth.

And they'll take your health,  
They'll take your freedom,  
And they'll take your wealth.
