Wandering letters  
From the avenues  
They find their way to you  
They find their way to you  

Words of a lover  
From a different time  
They find their way to you  
They find their way to you  

And I  
I don't know why  
I don't know why  
I don't know why  

Wandering letters  
From the avenues  
They find their way to you  
They find their way to you  

Words of a lover  
From a different time  
They find their way to you  
They find their way to you  

And I  
I don't know why  
I don't know why  
I don't know why  

Wandering letters  
From the avenues  
They find their way to you  
They find their way to you
