Clearing the fog  
Will we ever see the light?  
The haze is thick  
But we must find a way  

Through the shadows  
We walk in silence  
Seeking redemption  
In the depths of our minds  

Atonement calls  
In whispers of the night  
We search for solace  
In the echoes of our past  

The path is long  
But we must carry on  
With every step  
We seek the dawn  

In the darkness  
We find our strength  
In the silence  
We find our peace  

Atonement calls  
In whispers of the night  
We search for solace  
In the echoes of our past  

Through the shadows  
We walk in silence  
Seeking redemption  
In the depths of our minds  

Atonement calls  
In whispers of the night  
We search for solace  
In the echoes of our past
