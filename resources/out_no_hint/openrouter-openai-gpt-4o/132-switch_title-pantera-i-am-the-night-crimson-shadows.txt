I am the one who bleeds your blood  
I am the one who feels your pain  
Fear is my friend, hate is my love  
I am the one who doesn't feel the same  

Crimson shadows, crimson shadows  
Crimson shadows, crimson shadows  

I am the one who takes your life  
I am the one who feels no shame  
Fear is my friend, hate is my love  
I am the one who doesn't feel the same  

Crimson shadows, crimson shadows  
Crimson shadows, crimson shadows  

I am the one who bleeds your blood  
I am the one who feels your pain  
Fear is my friend, hate is my love  
I am the one who doesn't feel the same  

Crimson shadows, crimson shadows  
Crimson shadows, crimson shadows
