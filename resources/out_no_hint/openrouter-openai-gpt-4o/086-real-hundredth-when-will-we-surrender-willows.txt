I am the wind through the willows  
I am the storm, the fury and scorn  
I am the calm, the eye, the safe inside  
I am the waves, the crashing tides  

I am the voice that beckons you  
I am the choice that you must choose  
I am the hand that reaches out  
I am the truth that you can't doubt  

I am the wind through the willows  
I am the storm, the fury and scorn  
I am the calm, the eye, the safe inside  
I am the waves, the crashing tides  

I am the voice that beckons you  
I am the choice that you must choose  
I am the hand that reaches out  
I am the truth that you can't doubt  

I am the wind through the willows  
I am the storm, the fury and scorn  
I am the calm, the eye, the safe inside  
I am the waves, the crashing tides  

I am the voice that beckons you  
I am the choice that you must choose  
I am the hand that reaches out  
I am the truth that you can't doubt
