I am the new way to go  
I am the way of the future  

There's a trouble in the world  
A tragic case of overload  
And there's a problem with the girls  
But you know I got it all under control  

You can look, you can touch  
You know I got it all under control  
You can taste, you can feel  
But you know I got it all under control  

I am the new way to go  
I am the way of the future  

There's a trouble in the world  
A tragic case of overload  
And there's a problem with the girls  
But you know I got it all under control  

You can look, you can touch  
You know I got it all under control  
You can taste, you can feel  
But you know I got it all under control  

I am the new way to go  
I am the way of the future  

I am the new way to go  
I am the way of the future  

I am the new way to go  
I am the way of the future  

I am the new way to go  
I am the way of the future
