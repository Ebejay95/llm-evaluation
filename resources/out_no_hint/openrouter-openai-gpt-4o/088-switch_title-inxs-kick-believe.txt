Come on, come on  
I see you walking  
You turn your head  
And I see you talking  

With all my friends  
I'm shadowed under  
You're like some thunder  
I wanna be your  

I wanna be your  
I wanna be your  
I wanna be your  
I wanna be your  

Come on, come on  
Love is on the line  
Is on the line  
Is on the line  

Come on, come on  
Love is on the line  
Is on the line  
Is on the line  

Come on, come on  
Love is on the line  
Is on the line  
Is on the line  

Come on, come on  
Love is on the line  
Is on the line  
Is on the line  

I wanna be your  
I wanna be your  
I wanna be your  
I wanna be your  

Come on, come on  
Love is on the line  
Is on the line  
Is on the line  

Come on, come on  
Love is on the line  
Is on the line  
Is on the line  

Come on, come on  
Love is on the line  
Is on the line  
Is on the line  

Come on, come on  
Love is on the line  
Is on the line  
Is on the line  

I wanna be your  
I wanna be your  
I wanna be your  
I wanna be your
