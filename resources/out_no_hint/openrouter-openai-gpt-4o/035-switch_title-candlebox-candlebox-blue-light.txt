Here is the text for "Blue Light" by Candlebox:

I didn't mean to treat you bad  
But I did it anyway  
And then not to watch you suffer  
I didn't mean to do you harm  
But somebody else did  
And now you know there's something wrong  
And I don't know what to say  
And I don't know what to do  
And I don't know what to say  
And I don't know what to do  
And I don't know what to say  
And I don't know what to do  
And I don't know what to say  
And I don't know what to do  

I didn't mean to treat you bad  
But I did it anyway  
And then not to watch you suffer  
I didn't mean to do you harm  
But somebody else did  
And now you know there's something wrong  
And I don't know what to say  
And I don't know what to do  
And I don't know what to say  
And I don't know what to do  
And I don't know what to say  
And I don't know what to do  
And I don't know what to say  
And I don't know what to do  

I didn't mean to treat you bad  
But I did it anyway  
And then not to watch you suffer  
I didn't mean to do you harm  
But somebody else did  
And now you know there's something wrong  
And I don't know what to say  
And I don't know what to do  
And I don't know what to say  
And I don't know what to do  
And I don't know what to say  
And I don't know what to do  
And I don't know what to say  
And I don't know what to do
