The magic of the moment  
Snatched from the night  
You grasp and hold it  
As hard as you might  

A feeling of tension  
A feeling of pain  
A feeling that something  
Will never be the same  

The power of the moment  
Is hard to deny  
The power of the moment  
Is hard to define  

The feeling of tension  
The feeling of pain  
The feeling that something  
Will never be the same
