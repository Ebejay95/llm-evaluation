The angels of hatred are calling me  
My master is waiting, I'll soon be free  
The darkened abyss, where I will dwell  
Eternal nemesis, I bid you farewell  

The winds of darkness, my soul will take  
The shadows of death, my soul shall rape  
The shadow of death, the end is near  
The shadow of death, I have no fear  

The angels of hatred are calling me  
My master is waiting, I'll soon be free  
The darkened abyss, where I will dwell  
Eternal nemesis, I bid you farewell  

The winds of darkness, my soul will take  
The shadows of death, my soul shall rape  
The shadow of death, the end is near  
The shadow of death, I have no fear
