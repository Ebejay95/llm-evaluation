I watched you walk away  
Helpless, with nothing to say  
I strain my eyes  
Hoping to see you again  

This is my curse  
This is my curse  
This is my curse  
This is my curse  

Love, as fragile as a rose  
In your hand  
In your hand  
It slips through  
Your fingers like sand  

This is my curse  
This is my curse  
This is my curse  
This is my curse  

This is my curse  
This is my curse  
This is my curse  
This is my curse  

There is love burning to find you  
Will you wait for me?  
Will you be there?  

Your silence haunts me  
But I still hunger for you  

This is my curse  
This is my curse  
This is my curse  
This is my curse  

There is love burning to find you  
Will you wait for me?  

Still I want  
And I still I ache  
But still I wait  
To see you again  

Dying, inside, these
