I am the white light  
I am the darkness  
I am the listening ear  
I am the hunger  
I am the thirst  
I am the ghost that will haunt you for years  
I am the purest  
I am the cursed  
I am the voice that will not disappear  
I am the white light  
I am the darkness  
I am the voice that will not disappear  

I am the white light  
I am the darkness  
I am the listening ear  
I am the hunger  
I am the thirst  
I am the ghost that will haunt you for years  
I am the purest  
I am the cursed  
I am the voice that will not disappear  
I am the white light  
I am the darkness  
I am the voice that will not disappear
