Lights of waves, lights of waves
Guiding me through the night
Lights of waves, lights of waves
Guiding me through the night

I'm sailing on the ocean
With the wind in my hair
Lights of waves, lights of waves
Guiding me through the night

I'm searching for a place
Where the stars never fade
Lights of waves, lights of waves
Guiding me through the night

Through the storm and the calm
I'll find my way home
Lights of waves, lights of waves
Guiding me through the night

I'll follow the lights
Of the waves, of the waves
Guiding me through the night
Through the night, through the night

Lights of waves, lights of waves
Guiding me through the night
Lights of waves, lights of waves
Guiding me through the night
