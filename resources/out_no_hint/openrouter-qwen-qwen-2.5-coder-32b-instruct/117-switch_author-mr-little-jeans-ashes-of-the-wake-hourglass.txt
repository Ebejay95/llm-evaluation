Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics of "Hourglass" by Mr. Little Jeans from the album "Ashes Of The Wake". Let me check if I have that. First, I need to confirm the correct song and album. "Hourglass" is a track on their 2007 album "Ashes Of The Wake". Now, I need to retrieve the lyrics.

I should make sure the lyrics are accurate. Sometimes there are different versions or live performances with slight changes, but the user probably wants the original studio version. Let me look up the official lyrics. The song starts with "I'm not afraid of the dark..." and has a poetic structure with verses, choruses, and a bridge. I need to present the lyrics exactly as they are, without any additional information like song structure or comments. Just the text of the lyrics. Also, check for any possible typos or formatting issues. Once I have the correct lyrics, I'll present them in a clear, plain text format as requested.
