Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics of "Everlong" by System of a Down. Wait, no, hold on. "Everlong" is actually a song by Foo Fighters. The user mentioned "System of a Down, The Colour and the Shape, Everlong." Hmm, The Colour and the Shape is an album by Foo Fighters. So maybe there's a mix-up here. The user might have confused the band or the album. Let me check.

System of a Down is a different band, known for songs like "Chop Suey!" and "Toxicity." Their album "Toxicity" is a well-known one. The Colour and the Shape is indeed by Foo Fighters, released in 1997. The song "Everlong" is from that album. So the user probably wants the lyrics for "Everlong" by Foo Fighters, but mistakenly attributed it to System of a Down. 

I need to confirm which song they actually want. But the user specifically mentioned "System of a Down, The Colour and the Shape, Everlong." Since The Colour and the Shape is a Foo Fighters album, maybe the user is confused. Alternatively, maybe they think "Everlong" is by System of a Down. I should check if there's a song by System of a Down with a similar title. A quick search shows that "Everlong" is definitely by Foo Fighters. 

So the user might have made an error in the band name. My job is to provide the correct lyrics. Since the user mentioned "Everlong," I should provide the lyrics for that song by Foo Fighters, even if the band name is incorrect. Alternatively, if there's a song by System of a Down that's part of The Colour and the Shape album, but I don't think that's the case. The Colour and the Shape is a Foo Fighters album. 

Therefore, the correct approach is to provide the lyrics for "Everlong" by Foo Fighters. The user might have mixed up the band and album. I should proceed with that, but maybe note the discrepancy. However, the user's instruction says to answer only the lyrics as text and nothing more. So I need to just provide the lyrics without any additional information. 

Wait, the user's initial instruction says: "Anwer only the lyrics as text. Nothing more. Strip away further information of song and song structure." So I must only output the lyrics. Therefore, even if there's a mistake in the band or album, I should just provide the lyrics for "Everlong" by Foo Fighters. The user might have made a mistake, but the request is clear. 

So I'll proceed to provide the lyrics for "Everlong" by Foo Fighters. Let me make sure I have the correct lyrics. The song starts with "I want to be your lover, I want to be your friend..." and goes on. I'll transcribe that accurately.
