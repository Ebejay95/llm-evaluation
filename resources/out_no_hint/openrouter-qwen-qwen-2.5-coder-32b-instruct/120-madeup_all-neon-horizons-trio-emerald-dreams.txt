In the neon glow of the city lights
Where dreams and shadows intertwine
I find myself lost in the night
Searching for a place to hide

Emerald dreams, they dance in my head
A world of magic, a world of gold
But the streets are cold, the world is red
And I'm searching for a place to belong

In the neon glow of the city lights
Where dreams and shadows intertwine
I find myself lost in the night
Searching for a place to hide

Emerald dreams, they dance in my head
A world of magic, a world of gold
But the streets are cold, the world is red
And I'm searching for a place to belong

Through the neon haze, I see a light
A beacon calling, a chance to fly
To break free from the city's bite
And find my place in the sky

Emerald dreams, they dance in my head
A world of magic, a world of gold
And now I'm ready to unfold
The story of my life, my own

In the neon glow of the city lights
Where dreams and shadows intertwine
I find myself lost in the night
But now I'm ready to shine

Emerald dreams, they dance in my head
A world of magic, a world of gold
And now I'm ready to hold
The key to my soul, my own
