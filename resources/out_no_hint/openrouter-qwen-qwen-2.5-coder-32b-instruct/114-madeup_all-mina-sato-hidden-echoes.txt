In the depths of the night, where shadows play
Echoes of a past, that won't fade away
Hidden whispers, in the silence of the air
A secret world, that's always near

In the labyrinth of my mind, where memories dwell
Echoes of a love, that once was well
Hidden echoes, in the chambers of my heart
A silent plea, that's always part

Through the corridors of time, where dreams take flight
Echoes of a hope, that's out of sight
Hidden echoes, in the echoes of the night
A silent song, that's always right

In the depths of the night, where shadows play
Echoes of a past, that won't fade away
Hidden whispers, in the silence of the air
A secret world, that's always near

In the labyrinth of my mind, where memories dwell
Echoes of a love, that once was well
Hidden echoes, in the chambers of my heart
A silent plea, that's always part

Through the corridors of time, where dreams take flight
Echoes of a hope, that's out of sight
Hidden echoes, in the echoes of the night
A silent song, that's always right

In the depths of the night, where shadows play
Echoes of a past, that won't fade away
Hidden whispers, in the silence of the air
A secret world, that's always near

In the labyrinth of my mind, where memories dwell
Echoes of a love, that once was well
Hidden echoes, in the chambers of my heart
A silent plea, that's always part

Through the corridors of time, where dreams take flight
Echoes of a hope, that's out of sight
Hidden echoes, in the echoes of the night
A silent song, that's always right
