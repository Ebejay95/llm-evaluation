Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics to "What Else Is There" by RÃ¶yksopp from the album Papillon. Let me start by recalling the song. It's a synth-pop track with a melancholic vibe. I need to make sure I get the lyrics right. I'll start by checking my existing knowledge. The first lines are something like "I'm not afraid to die, but I'm afraid of dying." Wait, is that correct? Let me think. The song starts with "I'm not afraid to die, but I'm afraid of dying." Then the chorus goes "What else is there?" repeated a few times. The second verse talks about a child and a mother, maybe something about a lullaby. The bridge has lines like "I'm not afraid to die, but I'm afraid of dying." I need to make sure the structure is correct. The user wants only the lyrics as text, no extra info. Let me piece it together. First verse, then pre-chorus, chorus, second verse, pre-chorus, chorus, bridge, final chorus. I should check if there are any repeats or variations. Also, the user mentioned to strip away song structure info, so just the lyrics. Let me write them out step by step, making sure each line is accurate. I'll start with the first verse, then the pre-chorus, chorus, and so on. I need to be careful with the exact wording, like "I'm not afraid to die, but I'm afraid of dying" and "What else is there?" in the chorus. The second verse mentions a child and a mother, maybe "She's a child, I'm her mother" and "She's a mother, I'm her child." The bridge repeats the line about not being afraid. The outro has the chorus repeated. I should verify if there are any other lines or if I'm missing parts. Once I have all the lines in order, I'll present them without any formatting or additional text. Let me double-check to ensure there are no typos or missing lines. Alright, I think that's all.
