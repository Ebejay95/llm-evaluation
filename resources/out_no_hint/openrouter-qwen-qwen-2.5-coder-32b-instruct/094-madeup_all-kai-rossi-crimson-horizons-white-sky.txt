I'm reaching for the sky
But it's just out of my sight
I'm searching for a way
To break this endless night

I'm climbing up the wall
But it's just a pointless fall
I'm searching for a way
To break this endless night

White sky, white sky
Can't you hear me cry
White sky, white sky
Can't you see me try

I'm reaching for the sky
But it's just out of my sight
I'm searching for a way
To break this endless night

White sky, white sky
Can't you hear me cry
White sky, white sky
Can't you see me try

I'm reaching for the sky
But it's just out of my sight
I'm searching for a way
To break this endless night

White sky, white sky
Can't you hear me cry
White sky, white sky
Can't you see me try

I'm reaching for the sky
But it's just out of my sight
I'm searching for a way
To break this endless night

White sky, white sky
Can't you hear me cry
White sky, white sky
Can't you see me try
