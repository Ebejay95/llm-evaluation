Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics of "The Fodder Song" by Bob Seger, specifically the part titled "Words (Of The Dying)". Let me start by recalling if I know this song. Bob Seger has a lot of songs, but I'm not immediately familiar with "The Fodder Song". Maybe it's a lesser-known track or from a specific album.

First, I should verify if "The Fodder Song" is a real song by Bob Seger. A quick mental check: I know songs like "Old Time Rock and Roll", "Night Moves", and "Against the Wind". "The Fodder Song" doesn't ring a bell. Maybe it's a different title or a live version? Alternatively, could there be a mix-up with the title? Sometimes people confuse similar-sounding song names.

Next, the user mentioned "Words (Of The Dying)". That sounds like a subtitle or a specific section of the song. Maybe it's a part of a longer track or a different version. I need to check if this is part of an album or a specific release. If I can't recall, perhaps I should consider that the user might have the title slightly wrong or that it's a rare track.

Since I can't access external resources, I have to rely on my existing knowledge. If I don't know the lyrics, I should inform the user that I can't provide them. It's important to be honest and not make up lyrics. Maybe suggest that they check the title or provide more context. Alternatively, if there's a similar song, I could mention that, but I need to be careful not to mislead.

Another angle: sometimes songs have different titles in different regions or versions. Could "The Fodder Song" be known under another name? I'm not sure. Also, "Words (Of The Dying)" might be a poem or a spoken word piece included in the song. Without knowing the exact lyrics, I can't confirm.

In conclusion, since I don't have the lyrics for this specific song and part, the best response is to state that I can't provide them and perhaps ask if there's another song they're looking for. It's better to be accurate than to give incorrect information.
