Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics to "No Relief" by Defeater from the album "Letters Home". Let me check my database. I need to make sure I have the correct song. Sometimes there are similar titles, so I should verify the album and band. Once confirmed, I'll extract the lyrics. The user specified to only provide the lyrics as text, no extra info or structure. So I need to present them in a clean format without any song structure markers like [Verse 1] or [Chorus]. Also, no additional commentary. Just the raw lyrics. Let me double-check the lyrics to ensure accuracy. If there are any typos or formatting issues, correct them. Alright, I think that's all. Ready to output the lyrics.
