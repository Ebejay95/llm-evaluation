Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics of "Get Lucky" by Daft Punk, specifically the Radio Edit version. Let me start by recalling the song. "Get Lucky" is a collaboration with Pharrell Williams and Nile Rodgers. The Radio Edit might be a shorter version of the original track, so I need to make sure I get the correct lyrics without any extended parts or instrumental sections that might be in the full version.

First, I should check if there's a notable difference between the Radio Edit and the original. Sometimes, radio edits trim the intro, outro, or certain instrumental breaks. I need to confirm if the lyrics are the same but just arranged differently. From what I remember, the Radio Edit of "Get Lucky" is pretty similar to the original, just a bit shorter, so the lyrics might be the same. 

Next, I need to make sure I have the correct lyrics. Let me recall the structure: verse, pre-chorus, chorus, then repeats. The song has a distinctive bassline by Nile Rodgers, and the lyrics are about luck and living in the moment. The user wants only the lyrics as text, no additional info. So I need to present them in order, stripping out any song structure labels like [Verse 1], [Chorus], etc. 

Wait, the user specified to answer only the lyrics as text and strip away further information of song and song structure. So I should just list the lines without any brackets or labels. Let me check the original lyrics to confirm. The first lines are "We're up all night to get lucky..." and so on. The chorus is "Get lucky, get lucky..." 

I need to make sure I don't include any instrumental parts or notes about the production. Also, check for any possible typos or missing lines. Let me verify the lyrics from a reliable source. For example, Genius or AZLyrics. Comparing, the Radio Edit might have the same verses but maybe a shorter outro. However, the user just wants the lyrics, so even if the Radio Edit ends earlier, the text would be the same up to that point. 

So, putting it all together, I'll list each line of the song in order, without any formatting. Make sure to include all the verses and choruses as they appear in the Radio Edit. Also, check for any possible omissions or additions specific to that version. Since I can't listen to the track right now, I'll rely on my knowledge that the Radio Edit is a condensed version but retains the core lyrics. 

Finally, present the lyrics as a continuous text, line by line, without any markdown or additional explanations. That should meet the user's request accurately.
