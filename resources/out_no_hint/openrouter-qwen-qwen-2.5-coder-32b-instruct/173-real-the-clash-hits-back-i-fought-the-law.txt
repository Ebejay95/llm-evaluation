Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics to "I Fought the Law" by The Clash from their album "Hits Back". Let me start by recalling the song. I know it's a classic, but I need to make sure I get the exact lyrics right. The user specified to only provide the lyrics as text, no additional info or structure.

First, I should check if I remember the song correctly. The main lines are about fighting the law and losing, right? The chorus is "I fought the law and the law won." I need to make sure I don't mix up any lines. Let me think through the verses. The first verse starts with "I fought the law and the law won," then the second verse is similar but with "I fought the law and the law won." Wait, maybe the second verse is different? No, I think both verses are the same. Then there's a bridge with "Well, you know, how it was" and the story about the cop and the car. The outro repeats the chorus again.

I should also check for any possible typos. For example, "I fought the law and the law won" â€“ is it "won" or "was gone"? No, it's definitely "won". The bridge part: "He said, 'You're under arrest.'" Then the next line is "I said, 'But I didn't do anything wrong.'" Then the cop says, "You were speeding, and that's against the law.'" Then the response is "I said, 'But I didn't do it on purpose.'" Then the cop says, "Well, that's not my problem, son. You're going to jail.'" Then the next line is "And I fought the law and the law won."

Wait, I think the bridge is actually a spoken word part, but the user wants the lyrics as text, so I should include that. Also, the outro is the same as the chorus. Let me make sure I include all the lines in order. Let me structure it:

Verse 1:
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won
And I lost

Chorus:
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won
And I lost

Then the bridge with the dialogue. Then repeat the chorus again. Wait, maybe the structure is a bit different. Let me confirm. The song has two verses, each with four lines, then a bridge with the spoken part, then another verse, and outro. But I think the user just wants the full lyrics in order without noting the structure. So I'll list all the lines in sequence.

Also, check if there are any alternate versions. The original song is by The Clash, but there's also a version by The Beat, but the user specified The Clash's version. So I should stick to that. Let me make sure I don't include any lines from other versions. The lyrics are pretty straightforward, but I need to be precise. Once I have all the lines, I'll present them without any formatting, just the text. Alright, I think that's it. Let me put it all together.

I fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won  
And I lost  

I fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won  
And I lost  

Well, you know, how it was  
I was driving down the street in my car  
And I saw a cop, so I said to myself  
"Let me try to outrun him, I don't care"  

He said, "You're under arrest"  
I said, "But I didn't do anything wrong"  
He said, "You were speeding, and that's against the law"  
I said, "But I didn't do it on purpose"  

He said, "Well, that's not my problem, son. You're going to jail"  
And I fought the law and the law won  

I fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won  
And I lost  

I fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won  
And I lost
