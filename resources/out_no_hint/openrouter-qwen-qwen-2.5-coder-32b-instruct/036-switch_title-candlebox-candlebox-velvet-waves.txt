I'm a candle in the wind
I'm a fire in your mind
I'm a dream that you can't hide
I'm a memory that you can't deny
I'm a feeling that you can't define
I'm a moment that you can't confine
I'm a heartbeat that you can't confine
I'm a candle in the wind
I'm a fire in your mind
I'm a dream that you can't hide
I'm a memory that you can't deny
I'm a feeling that you can't define
I'm a moment that you can't confine
I'm a heartbeat that you can't confine
I'm a candle in the wind
I'm a fire in your mind
I'm a dream that you can't hide
I'm a memory that you can't deny
I'm a feeling that you can't define
I'm a moment that you can't confine
I'm a heartbeat that you can't confine
I'm a candle in the wind
I'm a fire in your mind
I'm a dream that you can't hide
I'm a memory that you can't deny
I'm a feeling that you can't define
I'm a moment that you can't confine
I'm a heartbeat that you can't confine
