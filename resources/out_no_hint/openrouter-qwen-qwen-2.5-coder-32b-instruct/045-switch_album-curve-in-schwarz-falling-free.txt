Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics to "Falling Free" by Curve from their album "In Schwarz." Let me start by recalling if I have access to that specific song's lyrics. I know that Curve is a British alternative rock band, and "In Schwarz" was released in 1993. "Falling Free" is one of their more well-known tracks.

First, I need to confirm the exact title and album to avoid any mix-ups. Sometimes songs have similar names or are part of different albums. But I'm pretty confident that "Falling Free" is indeed on "In Schwarz." 

Next, I should check if there are any common variations in the lyrics. Sometimes different sources might have slight differences due to live performances or re-releases. But for the original studio version, the lyrics should be consistent. 

I need to make sure I don't include any additional information like song structure (verse, chorus, etc.) as the user specified to only provide the lyrics as text. Also, they want nothing more, so no metadata or explanations. 

I'll start by writing out the lyrics line by line. Let me recall the first verse. It starts with "I'm falling free, I'm falling free," which is a strong opening line. The chorus is memorable with lines like "I'm not afraid to fall." 

I should be careful with the spelling and punctuation. For example, making sure that lines like "I'm a satellite, I'm a satellite" are correctly repeated. Also, checking for any possible typos. 

Another thing to consider is the bridge section. I think there's a part that goes "I'm a shadow, I'm a shadow," which adds a different texture to the song. Ensuring that this section is included accurately is important. 

I should also verify the outro. Does it repeat the initial lines or have a variation? From what I remember, it does loop back to "I'm falling free," giving it a cyclical feel. 

Let me piece it all together step by step. Start with the verses, then the choruses, followed by the bridge, and conclude with the outro. Making sure each section transitions smoothly as per the original song structure without labeling them. 

Wait, the user mentioned to strip away further information of song structure. So I shouldn't mention verses or choruses explicitly. Just present the lyrics in order. 

Let me double-check each line. For example, the line "I'm a satellite, I'm a satellite" is followed by "I'm a satellite, I'm a satellite," so repetition is key here. Also, the line "I'm not afraid to fall" is a refrain that's repeated in the chorus. 

I need to ensure that all repetitions are included as they appear in the song. Sometimes people might omit repeated lines, but since the user wants the full lyrics, I should include them all. 

Finally, proofread the entire lyrics to make sure there are no mistakes. Once that's done, present it as plain text without any formatting or additional comments, as per the user's request.
