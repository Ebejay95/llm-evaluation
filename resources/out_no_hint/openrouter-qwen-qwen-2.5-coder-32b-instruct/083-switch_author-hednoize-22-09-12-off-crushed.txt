Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics of "22-09-12 Off, Crushed" by Hednoize. Let me check if I have that in my database. Hmm, I'm not sure. First, I need to confirm the correct title and artist. Sometimes songs have similar names or different spellings. "Hednoize" might be a typo. Let me thinkâ€”there's a band called Hednoize, right? They have a song titled "22-09-12 Off, Crushed." I should verify the exact title. The user provided the date "22-09-12," which could be the release date or part of the title. Let me search my internal data for that.

Wait, I don't have access to external databases, so I have to rely on my training data. If I don't remember the lyrics, I can't fabricate them. The user wants only the lyrics as text, nothing else. If I can't find it, I should inform them that I don't have the lyrics. But maybe I can check if there's a similar song. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the title. Let me think again. Hednoize is a Japanese band, and they have a song called "22-09-12 Off, Crushed." I might not have the exact lyrics memorized. Since I can't look it up, I should respond that I can't provide the lyrics for that specific song. I need to make sure I don't give incorrect information. The user wants only the lyrics, so if I can't find it, I should just say that. Let me confirm once more. No, I don't have that song's lyrics in my training data. So the correct response is to state that I can't provide the lyrics for that specific request.
