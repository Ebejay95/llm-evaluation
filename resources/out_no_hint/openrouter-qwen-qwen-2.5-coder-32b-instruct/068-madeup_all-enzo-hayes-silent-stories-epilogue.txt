I close my eyes and I see your face  
In every shadow, in every place  
The memories linger, they don't erase  
The love we had, the time we made  

I hear your voice in the wind that blows  
A whisper soft, a lullaby  
But you're not here, you're far away  
And I'm just left with yesterday  

The stars still shine, the moon still glows  
But without you, the night feels cold  
I try to hold on, but I let go  
To the silence that surrounds my soul  

I close my eyes and I see your face  
In every shadow, in every place  
The memories linger, they don't erase  
The love we had, the time we made  

I hear your voice in the wind that blows  
A whisper soft, a lullaby  
But you're not here, you're far away  
And I'm just left with yesterday  

The stars still shine, the moon still glows  
But without you, the night feels cold  
I try to hold on, but I let go  
To the silence that surrounds my soul  

I close my eyes and I see your face  
In every shadow, in every place  
The memories linger, they don't erase  
The love we had, the time we made  

I hear your voice in the wind that blows  
A whisper soft, a lullaby  
But you're not here, you're far away  
And I'm just left with yesterday  

The stars still shine, the moon still glows  
But without you, the night feels cold  
I try to hold on, but I let go  
To the silence that surrounds my soul
