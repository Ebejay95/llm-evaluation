Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics of a song by Kelli Ali from the album "Equal Vision Records Presents - New Sounds 2011," specifically the track "Lucifer Rising." First, I need to confirm if this song actually exists. I'll check my database or available resources.

Hmm, Kelli Ali is known for her work with The Sugarcubes and her solo career. "Lucifer Rising" might be a lesser-known track or part of a compilation. The album title mentions "New Sounds 2011," which could be a compilation or a re-release. I need to verify if this specific song is part of that release.

If I can't find the lyrics in my existing database, I should inform the user that the lyrics aren't available. It's possible that the song isn't widely cataloged or that the lyrics aren't publicly accessible. I should also consider that the user might have the song from a specific source, like a live recording or a compilation, which might not have official lyrics.

I should respond by stating that the lyrics for "Lucifer Rising" by Kelli Ali from that album aren't available in my database. I need to make sure not to provide any incorrect or fabricated lyrics. It's important to be clear and helpful, maybe suggesting where they could look for the lyrics, like official sources or fan communities, but without violating any copyright rules.
