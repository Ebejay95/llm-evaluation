In the city of lights, where the neon never sleeps
I found a place where the shadows creep
Through the velvet patterns of the night
I found a way to forget

The green light flickers, a silent plea
In the fading horizons, where dreams are free
Through the velvet patterns of the night
I found a way to forget

In the city of lights, where the neon never sleeps
I found a place where the shadows creep
Through the velvet patterns of the night
I found a way to forget

The green light flickers, a silent plea
In the fading horizons, where dreams are free
Through the velvet patterns of the night
I found a way to forget

In the city of lights, where the neon never sleeps
I found a place where the shadows creep
Through the velvet patterns of the night
I found a way to forget

The green light flickers, a silent plea
In the fading horizons, where dreams are free
Through the velvet patterns of the night
I found a way to forget
