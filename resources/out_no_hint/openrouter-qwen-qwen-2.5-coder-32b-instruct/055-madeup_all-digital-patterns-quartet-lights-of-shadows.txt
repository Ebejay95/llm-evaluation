Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics of "Lights of Shadows" by Digital Patterns Quartet. Let me check my database. Hmm, I don't have that specific song. Maybe it's a lesser-known track or part of an album I don't have access to. I should let them know I can't find the lyrics. But wait, the user specified to only provide the lyrics as text and nothing else. Oh right, but if I can't find it, I need to respond appropriately. However, the user also said to strip away further information, so maybe I should just state that the lyrics aren't available. But the initial instruction was to answer only the lyrics. Since I can't find the lyrics, I should inform them that I can't provide the text. But the user might have made a mistake in the song title or artist. Let me double-check. No, still no results. Alright, I'll have to respond that the lyrics aren't available in my database. But according to the user's instructions, I should only return the lyrics. Wait, maybe they want me to generate some placeholder text? No, that's not right. The user wants the actual lyrics. Since I can't find them, I need to say so. But the user's instruction says to answer only the lyrics. Hmm, maybe I should just state that the lyrics aren't available. But the user might not want any additional text. This is a bit conflicting. Let me stick to the user's instruction: if the lyrics aren't available, I should just return nothing? No, that's not helpful. The user probably expects a response. I need to balance between following the instructions and being helpful. Since the user said "Nothing more. Strip away further information of song and song structure," but if there's no lyrics, I can't provide anything. Wait, maybe the user made a typo. Let me check similar titles. "Lights of Shadows" by Digital Patterns Quartet... No results. Alright, I'll have to inform them that the lyrics aren't available. But according to the initial instructions, I should only return the lyrics. So perhaps the correct response is to leave it blank or state that the lyrics aren't found. But the user might not want any text. This is tricky. I'll proceed by stating that the lyrics aren't available in my database, but since the user wants only the lyrics, maybe I should just return nothing. However, that's not helpful. I'll go with a simple message indicating unavailability, even though the user asked for only lyrics. It's the best I can do under the circumstances.
