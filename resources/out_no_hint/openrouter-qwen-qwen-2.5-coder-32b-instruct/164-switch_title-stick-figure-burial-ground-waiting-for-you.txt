Okay, the user wants the lyrics for "Waiting For You" by Stick Figure from the album "Burial Ground." Let me start by recalling the song. I know it's a reggae track with a romantic vibe. The user specified to provide only the lyrics as text, no extra info.

First, I need to make sure I have the correct song. "Waiting For You" is indeed on "Burial Ground." I should check the structure: verses, choruses, maybe a bridge. But the user said to strip away song structure info, so just the raw lyrics.

I'll start by writing out the first verse. The opening lines are about the moon and stars, setting a romantic scene. Then the chorus repeats "Waiting for you," so I need to capture that. The second verse talks about the ocean and waves. There's a bridge with a different perspective, maybe from the other person. I should include that. The outro repeats the chorus lines.

I need to be careful with the exact wording. Let me make sure I don't miss any lines. Also, check for any possible typos. Since the user wants only the lyrics, I won't add anything else like song structure tags or artist information. Just the text of the song from start to finish. Let me go through each part step by step to ensure completeness and accuracy.

I'm sittin' here in the moonlight  
With the stars shinin' so bright  
I'm thinkin' 'bout you every day  
And I can't help but feel this way  

I'm waitin' for you, I'm waitin' for you  
I'm waitin' for you, I'm waitin' for you  
I'm waitin' for you, I'm waitin' for you  
I'm waitin' for you, I'm waitin' for you  

The ocean is callin' my name  
But I can't go no further today  
I'm stuck in this place, I'm stuck in this time  
But I know you'll be comin' my way  

I'm waitin' for you, I'm waitin' for you  
I'm waitin' for you, I'm waitin' for you  
I'm waitin' for you, I'm waitin' for you  
I'm waitin' for you, I'm waitin' for you  

And if you're out there in the dark  
Hearin' the same things I'm hearin' in my heart  
Then come to me, don't make me wait  
'Cause I can't stand this pain no more  

I'm waitin' for you, I'm waitin' for you  
I'm waitin' for you, I'm waitin' for you  
I'm waitin' for you, I'm waitin' for you  
I'm waitin' for you, I'm waitin' for you  

I'm sittin' here in the moonlight  
With the stars shinin' so bright  
I'm thinkin' 'bout you every day  
And I can't help but feel this way  

I'm waitin' for you, I'm waitin' for you  
I'm waitin' for you, I'm waitin' for you  
I'm waitin' for you, I'm waitin' for you  
I'm waitin' for you, I'm waitin' for you
