Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics to "Jesus Christ" by Brand New from the album "The Devil and God Are Raging Inside Me." Let me confirm the song title and album to make sure I have the right one. Sometimes there can be similar titles, so I need to be precise.

First, I'll check the band's discography. Brand New's third studio album is indeed "The Devil and God Are Raging Inside Me," released in 2006. The track "Jesus Christ" is on that album. Now, I need to retrieve the lyrics for that specific song. 

I should make sure that the lyrics are accurate. Sometimes different sources might have slight variations, but I need to present the correct version. Let me cross-reference a couple of reliable lyric sites to confirm the text. Once I have the correct lyrics, I need to present them as plain text without any additional information like song structure, annotations, or metadata. The user specified to strip away further information, so I'll just provide the lyrics as they are. 

Also, the user mentioned to answer only the lyrics as text and nothing more. So I need to avoid any explanations or comments. Just the raw lyrics. Let me format it properly, making sure to preserve line breaks and stanzas as they appear in the song. 

Wait, the user might be a fan wanting to sing along, study the lyrics, or maybe for a project. Since they asked specifically for the text, I don't need to consider other uses. Just present the lyrics accurately. Let me double-check once more to ensure there are no typos or missing lines. Once confirmed, I can proceed to provide the lyrics as requested.
