Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics of "Rag Doll Blues" by SamHaiNe, specifically mentioning "Scissors." First, I need to confirm if "Scissors" is part of the song title or an additional note. Since the user wrote "SamHaiNe presents, Rag Doll Blues, Scissors," it might be that "Scissors" is part of the song's subtitle or a reference to a specific version. However, I'm not familiar with a song titled "Rag Doll Blues" by SamHaiNe. SamHaiNe is a Japanese artist known for hip-hop and R&B, but I don't recall this particular song.

I should check if there's any existing information or if the user might have a typo. Maybe "Rag Doll Blues" is a lesser-known track or a mixtape. Alternatively, the user could be referring to a collaboration or a remix. Since I can't find any official lyrics for this song, I need to inform the user that the lyrics aren't available in my database. It's possible the song is new, not widely released, or the title is incorrect. I should respond politely, explaining that I can't provide the lyrics and suggest verifying the song title or artist.
