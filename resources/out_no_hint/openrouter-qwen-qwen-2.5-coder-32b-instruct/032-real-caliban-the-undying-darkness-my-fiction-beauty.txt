In the heart of the night, where shadows play,
I wander alone, in a world of decay.
My fiction beauty, a ghostly light,
Guiding me through the undying darkness of night.

In the heart of the night, where whispers call,
I seek the truth, in the heart of the fall.
My fiction beauty, a guiding star,
Through the undying darkness, I'll find my way.

In the heart of the night, where silence reigns,
I hear the echoes, of my own insane.
My fiction beauty, a dream so real,
In the undying darkness, I'll find my peace.
