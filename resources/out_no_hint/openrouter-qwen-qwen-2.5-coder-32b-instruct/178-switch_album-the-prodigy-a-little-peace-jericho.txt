Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics to "A Little Peace" by The Prodigy from the album "Jericho." Let me start by recalling the structure of the song. I know The Prodigy's music often has a mix of electronic beats and spoken word or sung vocals. "A Little Peace" is one of their more melodic tracks.

First, I need to make sure I have the correct lyrics. I remember the song starts with a soft, almost lullaby-like melody. The lyrics are quite poetic and talk about peace, longing, and maybe some emotional turmoil. The user wants just the lyrics, no extra info, so I need to present them as a continuous text without any formatting or song structure notes.

Let me check the verses. The first part is something like "I want a little peace..." Then there's a chorus that repeats. I should make sure the lines are in the right order. Also, there might be some repeated lines or a bridge. I need to be careful not to mix up the verses. 

Wait, I think there's a part where the lyrics mention "I'm not a bad man" and "I'm not a bad man." That's a key line. Also, the song builds up with more intensity towards the end. Let me verify the exact wording. Maybe there's a line about "the devil's in the details" or something similar. 

I should also check for any possible typos or misheard lyrics. Since I'm not looking it up, I have to rely on my memory. Let me reconstruct the lyrics step by step. Start with the opening lines, then the chorus, then the next verse, and so on. Make sure each line flows correctly. 

Another thing to note is that The Prodigy sometimes uses non-English words or phrases, but I don't recall any in this particular song. It's mostly in English with a poetic touch. Also, the song might have a spoken word section, but I think the lyrics are more sung here. 

Once I have the structure, I'll present the lyrics as a continuous text without any markdown or formatting. Just the words as they appear in the song. Let me put it all together now.
