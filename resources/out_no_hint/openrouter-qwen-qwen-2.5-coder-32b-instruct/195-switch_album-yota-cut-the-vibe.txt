Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics of the song "Yota, Cut, The Vibe." First, I need to check if I have access to those lyrics. Since I can't browse the internet, I rely on my training data up until 2023. I should recall if this song is part of my knowledge base.

I'm not immediately familiar with a song by that exact title. Maybe it's a less popular track or from a newer artist. Alternatively, there might be a typo in the title. The user might have misspelled it. Let me think of similar-sounding song titles. "Yota" could be part of a longer title or a different spelling. "Cut" and "The Vibe" are common words in song titles, so that doesn't narrow it down much.

I should consider that the user might be referring to a song by an artist named Yota, but I don't recall any prominent songs by that name. Alternatively, it could be a collaboration between artists. Without more context, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact song. 

Since the user specified to only provide the lyrics as text and nothing else, I need to be cautious. If I don't have the lyrics, I should inform them that I can't retrieve the requested information. However, the user's instruction says to answer only the lyrics as text, so maybe they expect me to generate a response even if it's not accurate. But that's not appropriate. I should stick to the guidelines and only provide the lyrics if I have them. 

Given that I don't have the lyrics for "Yota, Cut, The Vibe," the correct response is to state that I can't provide the lyrics for that specific song. I need to make sure I don't make up any lyrics or provide incorrect information. The user might be testing if I can generate fake lyrics, but according to the instructions, I should only provide actual lyrics from my training data. 

Therefore, the best course of action is to inform the user that I can't retrieve the lyrics for that particular song. However, the user's initial instruction says to answer only the lyrics as text, so maybe they want me to return an empty response or a specific message. Since the user also mentioned to strip away further information, perhaps I should just state that I can't provide the lyrics without any additional explanation. But the user's instruction says to answer only the lyrics as text, so if there's no lyrics, maybe just a blank response. However, the user might be expecting a helpful message. 

Wait, the user's instruction says: "Anwer only the lyrics as text. Nothing more. Strip away further information of song and song structure." So if I can't find the lyrics, I should not provide any other information. But how to handle that? Maybe just return an empty string or a message that I can't help. But the user might have made a mistake in the title. Since I can't ask for clarification, I have to proceed based on the given title. 

In conclusion, since I don't have the lyrics for "Yota, Cut, The Vibe," I should respond with a message indicating that I can't provide the lyrics for that song. However, the user's instruction says to answer only the lyrics as text, so perhaps I should just state that I can't help without any additional text. But the user might be expecting the lyrics, so maybe I should check again. Let me think if there's any song that matches that title. 

No, I don't recall any song with that exact title. Therefore, the correct response is to inform the user that I can't provide the lyrics for "Yota, Cut, The Vibe."
