Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics of "2525 (Exordium & Terminus)" by Zager and Evans. They mentioned "Sunna" in the query, which might be a typo or a reference to the song's theme, but the correct title is "In the Year 2525". I need to make sure I provide the correct lyrics.

First, I should verify the song title and the artist. The user might have misspelled the title or the artist's name. Zager and Evans are the correct artists. The song is a classic, so the lyrics are well-known. I need to check if there are any variations in the lyrics across different versions, but generally, the standard version is the one from 1969.

Next, I should recall the structure of the song. It starts with "In the year 2525..." and goes through different decades, each with a different scenario. The user wants only the lyrics as text, without any additional information or formatting. I need to present them in a clean, line-by-line format without mentioning the song structure or any other details.

I should also check if there are any common mistakes in the lyrics that I should avoid. For example, the line "We'll be living in the future" is correct. Also, the part about "sun will burn out" is a key line. I need to ensure that all the verses and choruses are included accurately.

Since the user specified to strip away further information of the song and structure, I should just list the lyrics as they are, without any headings or annotations. Make sure there are no typos and that the line breaks are correct. Let me write them out now.

In the year 2525  
If man is still around  
He'll be living in the future  
And the future is now  
And the sun will burn out  
And the stars will all die

And the world will run dry  
And the children will weep  
And the old men will sigh  
And the sky will fall down  
And the mountains will cry
