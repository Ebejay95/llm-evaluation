Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics to "Fake Affront" by Puscifer from the album "Kunstraub". Let me check my database. I need to make sure I have the correct song and album. Puscifer is a band known for their eclectic style, so the lyrics might be a bit complex.

First, I'll verify the song title and album. "Fake Affront" is indeed on "Kunstraub". Now, I need to retrieve the lyrics. The user specified to only provide the lyrics as text, without any additional information or song structure. That means I shouldn't include verses, choruses, or any annotations.

I should check if the lyrics are available in my system. If they are, I'll present them exactly as they are, making sure there are no typos or formatting issues. If not, I need to inform the user that I can't provide the lyrics. But since the user mentioned "Kunstraub" and "Fake Affront", I think the lyrics are there.

Wait, sometimes lyrics can be tricky because of the band's unique style. Let me double-check the spelling of the song and album. "Kunstraub" is correct, and "Fake Affront" is the track. Once confirmed, I'll extract the lyrics and present them in plain text without any markdown or extra information. The user wants only the lyrics, so I'll strip away any headers or footers. Alright, I think that's all. Let me put the lyrics here.
