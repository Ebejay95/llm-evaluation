Red River, it's a place I know
Where the neon lights glow
But the windows are hollow
And the people inside are hollow too

Red River, it's a place I know
Where the neon lights glow
But the windows are hollow
And the people inside are hollow too

I see the faces in the windows
But they're not real
Just a reflection
Of what's inside

Red River, it's a place I know
Where the neon lights glow
But the windows are hollow
And the people inside are hollow too

I try to reach out
But the windows are closed
And the people inside
Are lost in their own world

Red River, it's a place I know
Where the neon lights glow
But the windows are hollow
And the people inside are hollow too

I wonder what's behind those windows
If there's any hope
Or if it's just a facade
Of a life that's not real

Red River, it's a place I know
Where the neon lights glow
But the windows are hollow
And the people inside are hollow too

I'll keep searching
For a window that's open
And a heart that's willing
To let me in

Red River, it's a place I know
Where the neon lights glow
But the windows are hollow
And the people inside are hollow too

I'll keep searching
For a window that's open
And a heart that's willing
To let me in

Red River, it's a place I know
Where the neon lights glow
But the windows are hollow
And the people inside are hollow too
