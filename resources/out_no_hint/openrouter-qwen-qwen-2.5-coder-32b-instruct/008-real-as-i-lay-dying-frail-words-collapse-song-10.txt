Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics to "Frail Words Collapse" by As I Lay Dying, specifically Song 10. First, I need to confirm the correct track. The album "Frail Words Collapse" was released in 2003, and it has 10 tracks. Let me check the track listing to make sure I'm getting the right song. The 10th track is "The Weight of the World." 

Now, I need to retrieve the lyrics for that song. I should make sure the lyrics are accurate and match the song. I'll start by recalling the structure of the song: verses, choruses, maybe a bridge. The user wants only the lyrics as text, so I need to present them without any additional information like song structure or metadata.

I should also check if there are any common variations in the lyrics. Sometimes, live performances might have slight differences, but the user probably wants the original studio version. Let me cross-reference the lyrics with a reliable source to ensure accuracy. Once I have the correct lyrics, I'll format them as plain text, line by line, without any markdown or extra text. Finally, I'll double-check that I'm not including any other information beyond the lyrics themselves, as per the user's request.
