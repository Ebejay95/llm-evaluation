Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics to "Crimson Scenes Trio, Paper Skylines." First, I need to check if I have access to those lyrics. Since I don't have a direct database of songs, I might need to recall or search for them. Wait, but the user specified to only provide the lyrics as text and not include any additional information. Also, they mentioned to strip away song structure details.

Hmm, I should make sure that I'm not including any metadata like verses, choruses, or song structure labels. The user wants just the raw lyrics. Let me think if I remember this song. "Crimson Scenes Trio" by Paper Skylines... I'm not entirely sure about the exact lyrics. Maybe I should verify if this is a real song. Sometimes, people might mix up band names or song titles. Let me check quickly. 

Wait, I can't browse the internet, so I have to rely on my existing knowledge. If I don't know the lyrics, I should inform the user that I can't provide them. But the user wants only the lyrics as text. Since I don't have that information stored, I should respond that I can't retrieve the lyrics for that specific song. I need to make sure I don't make up any lyrics. It's better to be honest and say I can't help with that request.
