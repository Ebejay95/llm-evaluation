Wandering letters, they're all I have
Of the days we spent, the nights we gave
The streets we walked, the songs we sang
The memories we made, they're all I have

Wandering letters, they're all I have
Of the days we spent, the nights we gave
The streets we walked, the songs we sang
The memories we made, they're all I have

I'm walking down the avenue
Looking for a sign, a clue
To where you are, where you might be
But all I find is just me

Wandering letters, they're all I have
Of the days we spent, the nights we gave
The streets we walked, the songs we sang
The memories we made, they're all I have

Wandering letters, they're all I have
Of the days we spent, the nights we gave
The streets we walked, the songs we sang
The memories we made, they're all I have

Looking for a sign, a clue
To where you are, where you might be
But all I find is just me

Wandering letters, they're all I have

The streets we walked, the songs we sang
The memories we made, they're all I have

Wandering letters, they're all I have
Of the days we spent, the nights we gave
The streets we walked, the songs we sang
The memories we made, they're all I have
