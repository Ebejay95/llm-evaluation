Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics of three songs: "No Name Face" by Mxmtoon and "Hanging by a Moment" by Lifehouse. Wait, "Hanging by a Moment" is actually by Lifehouse, not Mxmtoon. The user might have made a mistake there. Let me check the song titles again.

First, I need to confirm the correct song titles and artists. "No Name Face" is indeed by Mxmtoon. "Hanging by a Moment" is by Lifehouse. The user might have listed both under Mxmtoon by accident. Since the user specified "Mxmtoon, No Name Face, Hanging by a Moment", maybe they intended to get both songs but mixed up the artist for the second one. 

I should provide the lyrics for "No Name Face" by Mxmtoon and then "Hanging by a Moment" by Lifehouse. The user might not be aware that the second song is by a different artist. I need to make sure I don't include any extra information beyond the lyrics as per their request. They want only the lyrics as text, stripped of any additional info. 

Let me start by retrieving the lyrics for "No Name Face" by Mxmtoon. Then, for "Hanging by a Moment", I'll get the correct lyrics by Lifehouse. I need to present them in order, just the lyrics without any formatting or structure. Also, check if there are any verses or choruses, but the user wants the entire lyrics as a single text. 

Wait, the user mentioned "Hanging by a Moment" but didn't specify the artist. Since they listed Mxmtoon first, maybe they thought it's by her. But I should still provide the correct lyrics. Let me make sure I don't include any artist names or song titles in the response, just the lyrics. 

Double-check the lyrics for accuracy. For "No Name Face", the first verse is about not having a name or face, being a ghost. Then the chorus talks about being a shadow. For "Hanging by a Moment", the first verse is about a moment that could change everything. The chorus is the well-known part about hanging by a moment. 

I need to ensure that the lyrics are correctly transcribed without any errors. Also, since the user wants only the lyrics, I shouldn't add any explanations or notes. Just the raw text. Alright, I think that's all. Let me put them together.

[No Name Face lyrics]  
I don’t have a name, I don’t have a face  
I’m just a ghost in the background of your place  
I’m just a shadow in the corner of your room  
I’m just a thought that you forget too soon  
I don’t have a name, I don’t have a face  
I’m just a ghost in the background of your place  
I’m just a shadow in the corner of your room  
I’m just a thought that you forget too soon  
I’m just a whisper in the wind  
A flicker in the light  
A moment that you’ll never find  
But I’m still here  
I’m still here  
I’m still here  
I’m still here  
I don’t have a name, I don’t have a face  
I’m just a ghost in the background of your place  
I’m just a shadow in the corner of your room  
I’m just a thought that you forget too soon  
I’m just a whisper in the wind  
A flicker in the light  
A moment that you’ll never find  
But I’m still here  
I’m still here  
I’m still here  
I’m still here  

[Hanging by a Moment lyrics]  
I’ve been searching so long for something  
To believe in  
I’ve been searching the world since I was born  
Now I’m not sure if I’m alive or just surviving  
I’ve been locked outside of heaven  
Trying to find a way in  
But I’m just a soul with a broken heart  
And I’m hanging by a moment  
I’m hanging by a moment  
I’m hanging by a moment  
I’m hanging by a moment  
I’ve been searching so long for something  
To believe in  
I’ve been searching the world since I was born  
Now I’m not sure if I’m alive or just surviving  
I’ve been locked outside of heaven  
Trying to find a way in  
But I’m just a soul with a broken heart  
And I’m hanging by a moment  
I’m hanging by a moment  
I’m hanging by a moment  
I’m hanging by a moment  
I’m hanging by a moment  
I’m hanging by a moment  
I’m hanging by a moment  
I’m hanging by a moment
