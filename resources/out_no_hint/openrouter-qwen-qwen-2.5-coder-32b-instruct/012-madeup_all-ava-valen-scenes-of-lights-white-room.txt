Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics to "White Room" by Ava Valen from the album "Scenes of Lights." Let me check my database to confirm if I have that. Hmm, I don't recall having that specific song. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake with the artist or album name? Let me verify.

First, I know that "White Room" is a well-known song by Cream, written by Jack Bruce and Pete Brown. It's possible the user confused the artist. Ava Valen isn't a widely recognized artist in my database, so maybe they meant Cream. Let me check if there's a song called "White Room" by Ava Valen. No results come up. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a different version or a cover. But without more information, it's hard to say. Since the user specified to only provide the lyrics if available, and I don't have that particular song by Ava Valen, I should inform them that I can't find the lyrics. However, I should also mention the possibility of a mix-up with the Cream version to be helpful. But the user's instruction was to answer only with the lyrics if available. Since I don't have it, I need to respond accordingly without adding extra information beyond the lyrics. Wait, the user said "Anwer only the lyrics as text. Nothing more. Strip away further information of song and song structure." So if I can't find the lyrics, I should just state that, but the user might have made a mistake. But according to the instructions, I should only provide the lyrics if available. Since I don't have it, I should respond with that. However, the user might not know that Ava Valen doesn't have that song. But the user's instruction is strict. So the correct response is to say that the lyrics aren't available in the database. But maybe I should check again. Let me search once more. No, there's no "White Room" by Ava Valen. The user might have confused the artist. But I have to follow the instructions. So the answer is that the lyrics aren't available. I'll proceed to inform the user that the requested lyrics aren't in the database.
