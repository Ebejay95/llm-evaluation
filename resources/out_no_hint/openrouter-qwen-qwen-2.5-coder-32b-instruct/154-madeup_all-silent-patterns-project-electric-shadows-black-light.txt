In the black light, we dance
In the black light, we sing
In the black light, we hide
In the black light, we find

Electric shadows, they play
Electric shadows, they sway
Electric shadows, they guide
Electric shadows, they confide

In the black light, we're free
In the black light, we're me
In the black light, we're alive
In the black light, we survive

Electric shadows, they whisper
Electric shadows, they shiver
Electric shadows, they hold
Electric shadows, they unfold

In the black light, we're one
In the black light, we're undone
In the black light, we're lost
In the black light, we're crossed

Electric shadows, they call
Electric shadows, they enthrall
Electric shadows, they lead
Electric shadows, they bleed

In the black light, we're free
In the black light, we're me
In the black light, we're alive
In the black light, we survive
