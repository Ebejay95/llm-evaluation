I'm walking through the city
The neon lights are shining
I'm feeling like a stranger
In this world of mine
The skyline's so tall
It's reaching for the stars
But I'm just a small
Part of this big city
I'm walking through the city
The streets are full of people
I'm feeling like a stranger
In this world of mine
The skyline's so tall
It's reaching for the stars
But I'm just a small
Part of this big city
I'm walking through the city
The night is full of stories
I'm feeling like a stranger
In this world of mine
The skyline's so tall
It's reaching for the stars
But I'm just a small
Part of this big city
I'm walking through the city
The skyline's so tall
It's reaching for the stars
But I'm just a small
Part of this big city
