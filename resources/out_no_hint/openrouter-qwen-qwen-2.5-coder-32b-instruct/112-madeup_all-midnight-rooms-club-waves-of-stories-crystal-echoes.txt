In the midnight rooms club, we dance to the beat
Of waves of stories, in the crystal echoes
Lost in the rhythm, we're free from the heat
Of the world outside, we're just me and you

In the midnight rooms club, we sing our hearts out loud
In the waves of stories, we find our way around
The crystal echoes, they guide us through the night
In the midnight rooms club, we're alive, we're bright

In the midnight rooms club, we're more than just a crowd
In the waves of stories, we're living, we're proud
The crystal echoes, they ring with our dreams
In the midnight rooms club, we're home, we're kings

In the midnight rooms club, we're the ones who dare
To chase the waves of stories, beyond the air
The crystal echoes, they hold our secrets tight
In the midnight rooms club, we're free, we're right

In the midnight rooms club, we're the ones who sing
To the waves of stories, in the crystal echoes
Lost in the rhythm, we're free from the heat
Of the world outside, we're just me and you
