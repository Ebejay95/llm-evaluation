(Verse 1)  
The shadows creep where the light won’t stay,  
A whisper of rust in the hollow frame.  
The clock’s a thief, it steals the hours,  
Leaves the echoes of what we’re not.  

(Chorus)  
Black line, it cuts through the haze,  
A scar where the truth once lay.  
We’re dancing on the edge of the flame,  
Chasing ghosts in the crimson rain.  

(Verse 2)  
The mirror cracks, it tells no lies,  
A fractured self in borrowed skies.  
The wind it howls, a lonesome tune,  
A requiem for the things we’ve done.  

(Chorus)  
Black line, it splits the night,  
A wound that never feels right.  
We’re drowning in the weight of the fall,  
Sinking deeper into the crimson call.  

(Bridge)  
The stars they blink, then disappear,  
Like promises we can’t hold near.  
The road unwinds, no end in sight,  
Just the hum of the black line’s light.  

(Outro)  
Black line, it fades to gray,  
A fable lost to the dying day.  
We’re echoes now, a fleeting rhyme,  
Dissolving in the crimson time.
