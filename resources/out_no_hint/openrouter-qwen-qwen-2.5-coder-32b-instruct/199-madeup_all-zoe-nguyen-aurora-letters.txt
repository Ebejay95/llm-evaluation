In the quiet of the night
When the stars align
I find my way to you
Through the aurora lights

Letters in the sky
Guiding me to you
Through the aurora lights
In the quiet of the night

Aurora letters
In the sky so bright
Guiding me to you
Through the aurora lights

In the quiet of the night
When the stars align
I find my way to you
Through the aurora lights

Letters in the sky
Guiding me to you
Through the aurora lights
In the quiet of the night

Aurora letters
In the sky so bright
Guiding me to you
Through the aurora lights

In the quiet of the night
When the stars align
I find my way to you
Through the aurora lights

Letters in the sky
Guiding me to you
Through the aurora lights
In the quiet of the night

Aurora letters
In the sky so bright
Guiding me to you
Through the aurora lights

In the quiet of the night
When the stars align
I find my way to you
Through the aurora lights

Letters in the sky
Guiding me to you
Through the aurora lights
In the quiet of the night

Aurora letters
In the sky so bright
Guiding me to you
Through the aurora lights
