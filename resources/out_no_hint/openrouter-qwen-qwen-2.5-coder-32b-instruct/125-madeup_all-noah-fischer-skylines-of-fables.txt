Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics to "Skylines of Fables" by Noah Fischer. Let me check if I have that in my database. Hmm, I don't recall having that specific song. Noah Fischer isn't a mainstream artist, so maybe it's an independent or lesser-known track.

I should verify if the song exists. Maybe I can search for it online. Let me do a quick check. Oh, it seems like this might be a song from a smaller label or perhaps self-released. If I can't find the lyrics, I need to inform the user that I don't have access to them. But I should make sure not to provide any incorrect information. Also, the user specified to only return the lyrics as text and strip away any other info, so if I do find the lyrics, I need to present them cleanly. Since I can't browse the internet, I have to rely on my existing data. I don't have this song in my knowledge base, so the correct response is to state that I can't provide the lyrics for that specific track.
