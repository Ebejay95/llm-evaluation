Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics of the song "Pleasure Symbols, Closer and Closer Apart, Image Reflected." First, I need to check if this is a real song. I don't recognize the title immediately. Maybe it's from a lesser-known artist or a specific album. Let me search my database for the exact title.

Hmm, I don't find any matching results. The title seems a bit fragmented. Could it be part of a longer title? Maybe the user misspelled it. Let me try variations. "Closer and Closer" is a common phrase, but adding "Pleasure Symbols" and "Image Reflected" makes it unique. Perhaps it's a poem or a spoken word piece?

Wait, the user mentioned it as a song. Maybe it's from an independent artist or a niche genre. I should check if there's any song with similar lines. Alternatively, the user might have combined parts of different songs. For example, "Closer" by Nine Inch Nails or "Image Reflected" from another source. But the user wants the exact lyrics as text, so I need to be precise.

Since I can't find the lyrics, I should inform the user that the song isn't in my database. But the user instructed to answer only with the lyrics if available. Since there's no match, I should respond that the lyrics aren't found. However, the user might have made a mistake in the title. Maybe they can provide more details. But according to the instructions, I should only provide the lyrics if available. So, the correct response is to state that the lyrics aren't found in the database.
