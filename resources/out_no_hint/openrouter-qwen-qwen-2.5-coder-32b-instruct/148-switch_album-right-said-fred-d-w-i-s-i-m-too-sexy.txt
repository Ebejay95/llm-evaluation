Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics of "I'm Too Sexy" by Right Said Fred. Let me make sure I have the correct song. The song is indeed by Right Said Fred, and the title is "I'm Too Sexy." The user mentioned "D.W.I.S" which might be a typo or part of the song title, but I think they meant the correct title.

First, I need to recall the lyrics. The song is pretty straightforward and has a catchy chorus. The main lines are about being too sexy and the consequences. Let me check the structure: verses, choruses, maybe a bridge. The original song has a verse, then the chorus, another verse, chorus, bridge, and outro. I need to make sure I include all parts accurately.

Wait, the user specified to answer only the lyrics as text, nothing more, and to strip away further information of song and structure. So I shouldn't mention the song title or structure, just the lyrics. Let me start writing them out.

The first verse: "I like my baby, with the big long legs, I like my baby, with the big long tatts. I like my baby, with the big long..." Wait, the actual lyrics start with "I like my baby, with the big long legs, I like my baby, with the big long tatts. I like my baby, with the big long..." Hmm, maybe I should check the exact wording. Oh right, the first line is "I like my baby, with the big long legs," then the second line is "I like my baby, with the big long tatts," and the third line is "I like my baby, with the big long..." but the actual third line is "I like my baby, with the big long..." Wait, maybe the third line is "I like my baby, with the big long..." but I think it's "I like my baby, with the big long..." No, I think the third line is "I like my baby, with the big long..." but maybe it's "I like my baby, with the big long..." Wait, maybe I should just go from memory. The chorus is "I'm too sexy, I'm too sexy, I'm too sexy for this song." Then the second verse is similar but with "I like my baby, with the big long..." and so on. The bridge is about being too sexy and the consequences. Let me make sure I don't mix up any lines. Also, the outro repeats the chorus. I need to present the lyrics in order without any formatting, just the text. Let me put it all together now.
