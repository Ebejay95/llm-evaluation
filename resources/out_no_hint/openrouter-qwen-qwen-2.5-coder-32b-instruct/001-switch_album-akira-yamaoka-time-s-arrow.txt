Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics of "Time's Arrow" by Akira Yamaoka. Let me start by recalling if I have that information. Akira Yamaoka is a Japanese composer and musician, known for his work on the Silent Hill series. "Time's Arrow" might be one of his songs.

First, I need to confirm the correct lyrics. I should check reliable sources or databases where song lyrics are stored. Since I can't browse the internet, I have to rely on my existing knowledge. I remember that some of his songs have been released as part of his solo work or in the context of the Silent Hill games. 

Wait, "Time's Arrow" could be from the album "Silent Hill: Revelation 3D Original Soundtrack" or another project. Let me think about the structure of the song. Typically, his music can be quite atmospheric, maybe with a mix of electronic and orchestral elements. The lyrics might be in English, given the international audience of Silent Hill.

I need to make sure I don't confuse it with other songs by him. For example, "Theme of Laura" or "Silent Hill Theme." Let me try to recall the lyrics. If I can't remember exactly, I should avoid making up words. It's better to be accurate. 

Wait, I think "Time's Arrow" has a melancholic tone, with lines about time moving forward, maybe something about memories or loss. Let me try to piece it together. The chorus might have lines like "Time's arrow flies, can't turn back..." or something similar. 

But I need to be precise. If I'm not certain, I should inform the user that I can't provide the exact lyrics. However, since the user is asking specifically, I'll try to reconstruct it based on what I know. Let me check if there's any common structure. Maybe verses, chorus, bridge. 

Alternatively, maybe the song is instrumental. Wait, no, the user is asking for lyrics, so it's likely a vocal track. Let me think again. Akira Yamaoka's songs sometimes have poetic lyrics. Let me try to write out what I think the lyrics are, but I need to be careful not to invent words. 

If I'm not 100% sure, the correct response would be to state that I can't provide the lyrics. But given that the user is a lyrics librarian, maybe they expect me to have it. Let me try once more. 

I think the first verse might start with something like "In the shadow of the clock, where the seconds crawl..." Then a chorus about time's arrow. But I'm not entirely sure. Without being certain, I should avoid providing incorrect information. 

Therefore, the best approach is to inform the user that I can't retrieve the exact lyrics for "Time's Arrow" by Akira Yamaoka and suggest they check official sources or music platforms for accuracy.
