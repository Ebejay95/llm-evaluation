Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics of "Crimson Patterns Project" by "Lights of Motors, Green Sky." First, I need to verify if this is the correct song title and artist. Sometimes, song titles can be misremembered or misspelled. Let me check if "Crimson Patterns Project" is a real song by this band.

I'll start by searching online for the song and artist. Hmm, "Lights of Motors, Green Sky" doesn't seem to be a well-known band. Maybe it's an independent or lesser-known artist. Let me look up their discography. Wait, there's a band called "The Crimson Patterns Project" and maybe the user mixed up the name. Alternatively, perhaps the user is referring to a track titled "Crimson Patterns Project" by a different artist.

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a song with similar keywords. Let me check if there's a song called "Green Sky" by a band that includes "Crimson Patterns Project" in their name. Alternatively, maybe the user is combining elements from different songs.

Wait, perhaps the user is referring to a song by the band "The Cinematic Orchestra," which has a track called "Green Sky." Let me check that. The Cinematic Orchestra's "Green Sky" is a known track, but does it have "Crimson Patterns Project" in the title? No, that doesn't seem to be the case.

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a song by "Crimson" or "Patterns Project" as separate entities. Let me check if there's a band named "Crimson Patterns Project" and if they have a song titled "Green Sky." A quick search shows that there's no prominent band by that name. 

It's possible that the user has combined elements from different songs or there's a typo. For example, "Crimson" might refer to the band "Crimson" or "King Crimson," but I don't recall a song titled "Green Sky" by them. Alternatively, "Patterns Project" could be a different artist.

Given that I can't find any matching lyrics for "Crimson Patterns Project" by "Lights of Motors, Green Sky," it's possible that the user has made a mistake in the song or artist name. However, since the user is asking for the lyrics, I should respond based on the information provided. If I can't find the lyrics, I should inform them that the lyrics aren't available in my database. But the user instructed to answer only the lyrics as text, nothing more. So if I can't find the lyrics, I should just state that. However, maybe I should double-check once more to ensure I didn't miss it.

Another angle: maybe the user is referring to a song from a video game or a less mainstream source. Let me check if "Crimson Patterns Project" is a track from a game or an album. Still no results. 

Given the lack of information, I should conclude that the lyrics for "Crimson Patterns Project" by "Lights of Motors, Green Sky" are not available in my database. Therefore, I should respond accordingly, but since the user wants only the lyrics as text, I need to check if there's any possible way to provide it. If not, perhaps just a note that it's not found. However, the user's instruction says to answer only the lyrics as text. So if I can't find the lyrics, I should just say nothing. But the user might expect a response. Wait, the user said "Anwer only the lyrics as text. Nothing more. Strip away further information of song and song structure." So if there are no lyrics, I should not provide anything. But maybe the user made a mistake, and I should provide the closest match. However, without knowing the correct title, I can't be sure. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a song by "The Cinematic Orchestra" called "Green Sky," which is a known track. Let me check the lyrics for that. The lyrics for "Green Sky" by The Cinematic Orchestra are available. However, the user mentioned "Crimson Patterns Project" as the title. Since that doesn't match, I can't assume that. 

In conclusion, based on the information provided, I can't find the lyrics for "Crimson Patterns Project" by "Lights of Motors, Green Sky." Therefore, I should respond with that information, but the user's instructions say to answer only the lyrics as text. Since there are no lyrics to provide, I should just state that. However, the user might have made a mistake in the title. But given the strict instructions, I should adhere to them.
