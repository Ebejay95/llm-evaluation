Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics of "Lucid Dreams" by Yota, specifically "One By One." Wait, let me check. There's a song called "Lucid Dreams" by Juice WRLD, and another by Yota? Maybe the user is referring to a different artist. Let me confirm.

First, I need to verify if Yota has a song titled "Lucid Dreams" with a part called "One By One." Sometimes songs have verses or sections with titles. Alternatively, maybe the user is mixing up the artist names. Juice WRLD's "Lucid Dreams" is very popular, but the user mentioned Yota. Let me search for Yota's discography. 

Hmm, Yota is a Japanese artist, maybe a band or solo performer. Checking their songs, there's a track called "Lucid Dreams" which includes a part titled "One By One." I need to find the exact lyrics. Since the user wants only the lyrics as text, I should present them without any additional information. Also, make sure to strip away song structure notations like [Verse 1], [Chorus], etc. Just the raw lyrics. 

Wait, the user might have made a mistake in the artist name. Let me cross-check. If there's no Yota song with that title, maybe it's a different artist. But assuming the user is correct, I'll proceed. I'll look up Yota - Lucid Dreams lyrics and extract the part for "One By One." If I can't find it, I might have to inform the user, but the instruction says to answer only the lyrics if available. Since I can't access external resources, I need to rely on my existing knowledge. 

I don't recall Yota having that song. The most likely scenario is a mix-up with Juice WRLD. But the user specifically mentioned Yota. Maybe it's a less-known artist. Without access to the internet, I can't verify. In that case, I should respond that I can't find the lyrics for that specific request. However, the user wants only the lyrics as text, nothing more. So if I can't find it, I should just say nothing? Wait, the user said "Anwer only the lyrics as text. Nothing more. Strip away further information of song and song structure." So if I don't have the lyrics, I should not provide anything. But maybe I can provide the lyrics for Juice WRLD's "Lucid Dreams" if that's the intended one. But the user specified Yota. Hmm. This is a bit tricky. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a song by Yota called "One By One" from the album "Lucid Dreams." Let me think. If I can't find the exact lyrics, I should avoid providing incorrect information. Since I can't access external data, I have to rely on my training data. If my training data doesn't include that song, I can't provide the lyrics. Therefore, I should respond with nothing. But the user might be expecting an answer. However, the instructions are strict: only the lyrics, nothing more. So if I don't have it, I should not respond. But maybe I can check if there's a similar song. 

Wait, "One By One" is a common phrase. There's a song by The Beatles, but that's not relevant. Maybe the user is referring to a different song. Since I can't confirm, I'll have to state that I can't provide the lyrics for that specific request. However, the user's instruction says to answer only the lyrics. So perhaps the correct approach is to state that I can't provide the lyrics, but the user wants only the lyrics. This is conflicting. 

In conclusion, since I can't access external information and my knowledge might not include Yota's "Lucid Dreams" or "One By One," I should respond with nothing. But the user might be expecting an answer. Alternatively, maybe the user made a typo and meant Juice WRLD. If I provide Juice WRLD's lyrics, but the user asked for Yota, that's incorrect. So safest is to not provide anything. However, the user might be frustrated. But following the instructions strictly, I should only provide the lyrics if I have them. Since I don't, I should not respond. But the user's query is in the format of "Yota, Lucid Dreams, One By One," which might be a way to specify artist, song, and part. 

Given all that, I think the best approach is to inform the user that I can't find the lyrics for that specific request. But the user's instruction says to answer only the lyrics. Therefore, if I can't find it, I should not provide anything. However, the user might have made a mistake. Since I can't confirm, I'll proceed to state that I can't provide the lyrics for that
