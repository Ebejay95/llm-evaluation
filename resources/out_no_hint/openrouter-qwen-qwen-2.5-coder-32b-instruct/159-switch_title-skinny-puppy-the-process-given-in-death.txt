Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics to "The Process" by Skinny Puppy from the album "Given In Death." Let me start by recalling if I have that information. I know Skinny Puppy is a Canadian industrial band, and "Given In Death" is one of their albums. However, I'm not entirely sure about the exact track listing. Wait, "The Process" might be a track on that album.

First, I need to confirm the correct song and album. Let me think. "Given In Death" was released in 1992, and "The Process" is indeed a track on that album. Now, I need to retrieve the lyrics. Since I can't access external sources, I have to rely on my existing knowledge. I remember that Skinny Puppy's lyrics often deal with dark, philosophical, and existential themes. "The Process" might be about societal decay, human suffering, or industrialization's impact.

Let me try to recall the structure. Industrial music often uses repetitive, aggressive beats, and the lyrics might be in a similar vein. The title "The Process" suggests a systematic or mechanical theme. The user wants only the lyrics as text, so I need to present them without any additional information like song structure or commentary.

Wait, I should be careful not to make up the lyrics. If I'm unsure about the exact words, it's better to state that I can't provide them. But I think I can reconstruct some parts. For example, lines like "The process is a living thing" or references to machines and decay. However, without being certain, I might misquote. It's possible that the actual lyrics are more complex and specific.

Since the user emphasized to answer only the lyrics and strip away other information, I have to be precise. If I can't recall the exact lyrics accurately, I should inform the user that I can't provide them. Alternatively, if I can remember some parts, I should present them as accurately as possible. But given that I might not have the exact text, it's safer to state that I can't provide the lyrics for that specific song. I should also mention that Skinny Puppy's lyrics are often abstract and open to interpretation, which might make it harder to reconstruct them from memory.
