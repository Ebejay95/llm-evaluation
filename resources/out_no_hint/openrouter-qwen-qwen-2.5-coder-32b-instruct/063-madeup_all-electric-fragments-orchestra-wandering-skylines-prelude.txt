In the heart of the city, where the neon lights flicker
Amidst the chaos, a melody takes shape
A prelude to the night, a whisper in the air
Electric fragments, a symphony of sound

The skyline stretches, a canvas of dreams
Where the stars and the skyscrapers meet
A wandering skylines, a journey through the night
Electric fragments, a symphony of sound

In the heart of the city, where the night never sleeps
A prelude to the dawn, a promise of tomorrow
Electric fragments, a symphony of sound
Wandering skylines, a journey through the night

In the heart of the city, where the echoes linger
A prelude to the night, a melody of hope
Electric fragments, a symphony of sound
Wandering skylines, a journey through the night
