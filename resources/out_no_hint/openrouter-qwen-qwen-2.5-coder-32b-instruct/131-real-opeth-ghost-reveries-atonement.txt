In the depths of the night, when the shadows play,
And the stars above, they seem so far away,
I search for solace, in the silence of the mind,
To find redemption, to mend what's been unkind.

The echoes of the past, they haunt me still,
The memories of love, they linger like a thrill,
But the pain of the present, it cuts so deep,
In this world of sorrow, I find no peace to keep.

Atonement, it's a heavy price to pay,
To make amends for the things I've done astray,
But in the end, it's the only way to be free,
To rise from the ashes, and start anew with thee.

So I'll carry the burden, of guilt and shame,
And walk this path alone, until the end of time,
For in the act of atonement, I find my strength,
To break the chains of the past, and embrace the length.

Of a future where love and forgiveness reign,
Where the scars of the past, they no longer remain,
Atonement, it's the price I must pay,
To find my place in this world, and make a brand new day.
