Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics of "Careful" by Boy Harsher from the album "The Terminal." Let me check my database for that.

First, I need to confirm the correct song and album. Boy Harsher is an electronic duo, so "Careful" is likely a track from their 2020 album "The Terminal." I should make sure there's no other song with the same title from a different album.

Looking up the lyrics, I need to present them accurately. The user specified to only provide the lyrics as text, without any additional information or song structure details. So I should avoid mentioning verses, choruses, or any other structural elements. Just the raw lyrics.

I should also check if there are any alternate versions or common misquotations. Let me verify the lyrics against a reliable source to ensure accuracy. Once confirmed, I'll format the response as plain text, line by line, exactly as they appear in the song.

No markdown, no extra text. Just the lyrics. Let me double-check the spelling and punctuation to make sure there are no errors. Alright, that should do it.
