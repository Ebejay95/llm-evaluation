In the heart of the city, where the streets are alive
Amidst the chaos, where the stories thrive
In the heart of the city, where the dreams are born
Amidst the hustle, where the legends are torn
In the heart of the city, where the night is wild
Amidst the shadows, where the secrets are sealed
In the heart of the city, where the future is bright
Amidst the struggles, where the heroes fight
