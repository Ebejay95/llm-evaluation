Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics of "Strange Pleasures" by Still Corners from the album "Pubic Fruit". Let me check if I have that. I need to make sure I provide only the lyrics, no extra info.

First, I'll confirm the song title and album. "Strange Pleasures" is indeed on "Pubic Fruit". Now, I need to recall or look up the lyrics. Let me think... The song starts with something like "I'm a stranger to the sun..." Yeah, that's right. I should list out each verse and chorus accurately.

Wait, I need to be careful with the structure. The user wants just the lyrics as text, stripped of any song structure markers like [Verse 1] or [Chorus]. So I'll present them in order without those labels. Let me go through each part step by step to ensure I don't miss any lines. Also, check for any possible typos or missed lines. Once I have all the verses and choruses in order, I can present them as a continuous text. Alright, I think that's all. Let me put it all together now.
