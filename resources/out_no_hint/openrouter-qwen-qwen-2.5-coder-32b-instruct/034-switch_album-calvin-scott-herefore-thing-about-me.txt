Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics to "Thing About Me" by Calvin Scott from the album "Herefore". Let me check my database. Hmm, I don't have that specific song in my current collection. I should make sure I'm not confusing it with another song. Maybe the user misspelled the title or the artist? Let me double-check. Calvin Scott is a real artist, and "Herefore" is an album, but "Thing About Me" doesn't ring a bell. I could look up the tracklist for "Herefore" to confirm. Wait, maybe the song is called something slightly different. Alternatively, the user might be referring to a different song with a similar title. I need to be careful not to provide incorrect lyrics. Since I can't find the lyrics, the best response is to inform the user that I can't retrieve them and suggest they check the title or artist. I should also apologize for the inconvenience.
