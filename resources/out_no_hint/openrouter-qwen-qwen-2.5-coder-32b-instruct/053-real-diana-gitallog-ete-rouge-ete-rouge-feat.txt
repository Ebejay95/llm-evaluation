Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics of "Été Rouge" by Diana Gitallog, specifically the version featuring someone else. First, I need to confirm the correct song and artist. Diana Gitallog isn't a name I recognize immediately. Maybe it's a typo? Could it be Diana Gitari or another similar name? Alternatively, "Été Rouge" translates to "Red Summer" in English, so maybe it's a French song.

I should check if there's a known song with that title. A quick search in my database... Hmm, I don't find an exact match. There's a possibility that the song is less popular or from an independent artist. The user might have misspelled the artist's name. Let me try variations: Diana Gitari, Diana Gitlow, etc. Still no results. 

Since the user specified to only provide the lyrics as text without any additional information, I need to be careful. If I can't find the lyrics, I should respond accordingly. The user might be expecting the lyrics but I have to be honest if they aren't available. Also, the user mentioned to strip away song structure information, so even if I had the lyrics, I need to present them without verses, choruses labeled. 

Wait, maybe the user is testing me? They might have provided a fake song to see if I can generate lyrics. But I should stick to the guidelines. If the lyrics aren't in my database, I can't fabricate them. I should inform the user that the lyrics aren't available. Let me make sure there's no alternative title or common mispellings I missed. Still nothing. Alright, I'll have to respond that I can't provide the lyrics for that specific song.
