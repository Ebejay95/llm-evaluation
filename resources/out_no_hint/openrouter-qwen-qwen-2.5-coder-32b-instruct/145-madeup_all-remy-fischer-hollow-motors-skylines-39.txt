Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics of "Skylines #39" by Remy Fischer and Hollow Motors. Let me check if I have that in my database. Hmm, I don't recall having that specific song. Maybe it's a lesser-known track or part of a series like "Skylines" which might have multiple parts. I should verify if the song exists. Let me search my internal data... No results. The user might have misspelled the title or the artists. Let me check possible variations. "Skylines #39" could be part of a mixtape or an EP. Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a different song with a similar title. Since I can't find the lyrics, I need to inform them that I don't have access to those lyrics. I should also suggest checking the spelling or providing more context. But the user specifically asked to answer only the lyrics as text, so if I don't have it, I should just state that I can't provide the lyrics. Wait, the user's instruction says to answer only the lyrics as text, nothing more. So if I can't find the lyrics, I should just say "Lyrics not found" without any additional explanation. But the initial instruction says to strip away further information, so maybe just return nothing? Wait, the user's exact instruction was: "Anwer only the lyrics as text. Nothing more. Strip away further information of song and song structure." So if the lyrics aren't found, I should return nothing. But the user might expect a response. Hmm, but according to the instructions, I should only return the lyrics. Since I don't have them, I can't provide anything. So the correct response is to return an empty string or nothing. But maybe the user made a mistake in the title. Let me double-check. Remy Fischer and Hollow Motors â€“ "Skylines #39". Maybe it's a track from a game or a sound effect? Unlikely. Alternatively, maybe it's a DJ set or a mix where the track numbers are part of the title. Without more info, I can't proceed. So the answer is that I can't provide the lyrics as per the user's request.
