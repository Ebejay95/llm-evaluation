Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics of "You Want Some of This, I Don't Understand" by Jon Lajoie. Let me check if I have that. Hmm, I remember that song is part of his album "The Last踏破". I need to make sure I get the correct lyrics. Let me search my database.

Wait, sometimes there might be different versions or live performances. The user specified to answer only the lyrics as text, nothing more. So I need to present the lyrics exactly as they are, without any additional info like song structure or notes. Also, I should strip away any formatting. Let me verify the lyrics line by line to ensure accuracy. 

I think the song starts with "You want some of this, I don't understand." Then there's a chorus that repeats. Let me check each verse and chorus to make sure there are no typos. Also, note that the song has a humorous and satirical tone, so the lyrics might have some wordplay. I need to make sure the punctuation and line breaks are correct. Once I confirm the accuracy, I'll present the lyrics in plain text without any markdown or extra information. Alright, I think that's all. Let me put it together.
