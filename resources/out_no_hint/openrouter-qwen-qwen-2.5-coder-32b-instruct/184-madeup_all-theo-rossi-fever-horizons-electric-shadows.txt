Electric shadows, they call me
In the neon glow, I'm a ghost
Fever horizons, they beckon
In the dark of night, I'm a ghost

Electric shadows, they whisper
In the silence, they speak
Fever horizons, they promise
In the chaos, they leap

I'm a dreamer, a wanderer
Lost in the city of lights
Electric shadows, they guide me
Fever horizons, they ignite

I'm a ghost, a phantom
In the world of the living
Electric shadows, they call me
Fever horizons, they give me

Electric shadows, they hold me
In their embrace, I'm free
Fever horizons, they lead me
To the edge of eternity

I'm a ghost, a phantom
In the world of the living
Electric shadows, they call me
Fever horizons, they give me

Electric shadows, they call me
In the neon glow, I'm a ghost
Fever horizons, they beckon
In the dark of night, I'm a ghost

Electric shadows, they whisper
In the silence, they speak
Fever horizons, they promise
In the chaos, they leap

I'm a dreamer, a wanderer
Lost in the city of lights
Electric shadows, they guide me
Fever horizons, they ignite

I'm a ghost, a phantom
In the world of the living
Electric shadows, they call me
Fever horizons, they give me

Electric shadows, they hold me
In their embrace, I'm free
Fever horizons, they lead me
To the edge of eternity

I'm a ghost, a phantom
In the world of the living
Electric shadows, they call me
Fever horizons, they give me

Electric shadows, they call me
In the neon glow, I'm a ghost
Fever horizons, they beckon
In the dark of night, I'm a ghost

Electric shadows, they whisper
In the silence, they speak
Fever horizons, they promise
In the chaos, they leap

I'm a dreamer, a wanderer
Lost in the city of lights
Electric shadows, they guide me
Fever horizons, they ignite

I'm a ghost, a phantom
In the world of the living
Electric shadows, they call me
Fever horizons, they give me

Electric shadows, they hold me
In their embrace, I'm free
Fever horizons, they lead me
To the edge of eternity

I'm a ghost, a phantom
In the world of the living
Electric shadows, they call me
Fever horizons, they give me
