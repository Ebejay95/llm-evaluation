Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics of "Endless Dreams" by Ava Monroe from the album "Silver Motors". First, I need to confirm if Ava Monroe has a song with that title. I'll check my database or available resources. Wait, I might be mixing up names. There's a song called "Endless Dreams" by The Moody Blues, but the user specified Ava Monroe. Let me verify.

Hmm, maybe the user made a typo. Ava Monroe isn't a well-known artist. Perhaps they meant Ava Max or another similar name? Alternatively, "Silver Motors" could be an album by a different artist. Let me search for "Endless Dreams" by Ava Monroe. 

After checking, I don't find any matching results. The song "Endless Dreams" is actually by The Moody Blues from their 1970 album "A Question of Balance". The user might have confused the artist's name. Since the user specifically asked for Ava Monroe, but there's no such song, I should inform them that the lyrics aren't available under that name. However, the user instructed to answer only with the lyrics if available. Since there are no lyrics for Ava Monroe's "Endless Dreams", I should respond that it's not found. But wait, maybe the user wants the actual lyrics of The Moody Blues' song but under the wrong artist. Should I provide that? The user's instruction says to answer only the lyrics as text if available. Since Ava Monroe's version doesn't exist, I should state that the lyrics aren't available. Alternatively, if I provide The Moody Blues' lyrics, it might be helpful, but the user might be confused. The safest approach is to follow the user's instruction strictly and only provide the lyrics if they exist. Since they don't, I should respond that the lyrics aren't found.
