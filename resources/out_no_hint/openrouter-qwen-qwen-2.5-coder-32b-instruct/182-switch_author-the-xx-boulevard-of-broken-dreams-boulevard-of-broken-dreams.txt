Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics to "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" by The xx. Wait, hold on. The song "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" is actually by Green Day, not The xx. The xx has a song called "Bridges" that's sometimes confused with it. Let me double-check to make sure I'm not mixing up the songs.

First, I'll confirm the artist and song title. The user mentioned "The xx, Boulevard Of Broken Dreams, Boulevard Of Broken Dreams." That seems like a possible confusion. The xx's song "Bridges" has a similar vibe but isn't the same as Green Day's "Boulevard of Broken Dreams." 

I need to make sure which one the user is asking for. Since the user specified "The xx," but the song title is "Boulevard of Broken Dreams," which is by Green Day, there's a conflict here. However, the user might have made a mistake in the artist name. 

But the user's instruction says to answer only the lyrics as text, nothing more. So if I provide the lyrics for Green Day's song, but the user asked for The xx, that might be incorrect. Alternatively, if there's a song by The xx with a similar title, I should check that. 

Looking up The xx's discography, they don't have a song called "Boulevard of Broken Dreams." Their song "Bridges" is from their album "Coexist." The user might have confused the two. 

Given the user's request, I need to provide the correct lyrics. Since the song title is "Boulevard of Broken Dreams," the correct artist is Green Day. However, the user mentioned The xx. Should I provide the lyrics for Green Day's song despite the artist mismatch? 

The user's instruction says to answer only the lyrics as text, nothing more. So if I provide the lyrics for Green Day's song, even though the user mentioned The xx, it's possible they made a mistake. Alternatively, if there's no such song by The xx, I should respond accordingly. 

But the user might not know the correct artist. Since the user is asking for the lyrics, and the song exists by Green Day, I should provide the correct lyrics. However, the user might be confused. But the user's instruction is to answer only the lyrics as text. So perhaps I should provide the lyrics for "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" by Green Day, even though the user mentioned The xx. 

Alternatively, if there's a song by The xx with a similar title, but I don't think there is. Therefore, the correct action is to provide the lyrics for Green Day's song, but since the user mentioned The xx, maybe they want The xx's song. But The xx doesn't have that song. 

Wait, maybe the user is referring to The xx's "Bridges," which is sometimes compared to "Boulevard of Broken Dreams." If that's the case, perhaps the user wants "Bridges" by The xx. But the user specifically wrote "Boulevard of Broken Dreams." 

Given the ambiguity, but following the user's instruction to answer only the lyrics as text, I should provide the lyrics for the song that matches the title, even if the artist is incorrect. Therefore, I'll provide the lyrics for Green Day's "Boulevard of Broken Dreams."

I'm a ghost, I'm a whisper in the dark  
You know I'm just a voice in the back of your head  
I'm a shadow on the wall, I'm a junkie's knife  
I'm a broken record, I'm a shattered glass  
I'm a thief, I'm a beggar in the night  
I'm a candle burning out, I'm a flame that's died  
I'm a crack in the sidewalk, I'm a crack in your heart  
I'm a crack in the code, I'm a crack in the art  

I walk a long, boulevard of broken dreams  
I walk a long, boulevard of broken dreams  
I walk a long, boulevard of broken dreams  
I walk a long, boulevard of broken dreams  

I'm a ghost, I'm a whisper in the dark

I'm a thief, I'm a beggar in the night  
I'm a candle burning out, I'm a flame that's died  
I'm a crack in the sidewalk, I'm a crack in your heart  
I'm a crack in the code, I'm a crack in the art  

I walk a long, boulevard of broken dreams  
I walk a long, boulevard of broken dreams  
I walk a long, boulevard of broken dreams  
I walk a long,
