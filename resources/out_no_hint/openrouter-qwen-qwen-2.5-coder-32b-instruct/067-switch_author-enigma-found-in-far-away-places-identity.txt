I am the question and the answer
I am the beginning and the end
I am the circle and the spiral
I am the chaos and the order
I am the light and the shadow
I am the dream and the reality
I am the past and the future
I am the silence and the sound
I am the darkness and the light
I am the mystery and the truth
I am the one and the many
I am the same and the different
I am the known and the unknown
I am the self and the other
I am the friend and the enemy
I am the love and the hate
I am the life and the death
I am the beginning and the end
I am the question and the answer
I am the identity
