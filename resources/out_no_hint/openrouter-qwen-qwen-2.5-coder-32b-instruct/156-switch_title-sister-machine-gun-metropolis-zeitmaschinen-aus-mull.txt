Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics of "Sister Machine Gun" by Metropolis, specifically the version titled "Zeitmaschinen aus Müll." First, I need to confirm if this is the correct song. "Sister Machine Gun" is a track by Metropolis, but I should check if there's a version with that German title. Sometimes bands release different versions or remixes with alternate titles.

Next, I need to make sure I'm providing the correct lyrics. The user wants only the lyrics as text, without any additional information or song structure. I should avoid including metadata like the song's release year, album, or structure markers like [Verse 1], [Chorus], etc. The user emphasized stripping away all further information, so the response should be clean lyrics only.

I should also verify the lyrics to ensure accuracy. If there are any discrepancies in the lyrics from different sources, I need to cross-check to provide the correct version. Since the user mentioned "Zeitmaschinen aus Müll," which translates to "Time Machines from Trash," I need to confirm if this is a specific version or a different song altogether. It's possible that the user is referring to a live version or a remix with that title, so I should check if the lyrics differ from the original.

Additionally, I need to be cautious about copyright issues. Providing lyrics here might be against the terms of service, but since the user is asking for a lyrics librarian role, I assume it's for educational or reference purposes. However, I should still ensure that I'm not reproducing the lyrics in a way that infringes on copyright. If I can't find the exact lyrics, I should inform the user that I can't provide them due to copyright restrictions.

After verifying, if the lyrics are available and the user's request is valid, I'll present them in a plain text format without any formatting or additional text. If there's no such version, I'll need to clarify or provide the standard lyrics of "Sister Machine Gun" by Metropolis instead.
