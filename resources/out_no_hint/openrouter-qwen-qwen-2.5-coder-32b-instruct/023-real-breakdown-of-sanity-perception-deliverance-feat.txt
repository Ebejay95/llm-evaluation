Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics of the song "Breakdown of Sanity, Perception, Deliverance (feat..." but the title is cut off. I need to figure out which song they're referring to. The title sounds like it could be a metal or rock song, maybe by a band like Opeth or another similar group. Let me check my database for songs with that title.

Wait, "Breakdown of Sanity" is a song by Opeth from their album "Deliverance". The user might be combining the song title with the album name. The "(feat" part is probably a typo or incomplete. The actual song is "Breakdown of Sanity" from the "Deliverance" album. Let me confirm the lyrics for that song. 

I should make sure there's no other song with a similar title. Once I have the correct lyrics, I need to present them as text without any additional information, as per the user's request. Also, the user mentioned stripping away song structure info, so I'll just provide the lyrics line by line without verses or choruses labeled. Let me retrieve the lyrics and format them correctly.
