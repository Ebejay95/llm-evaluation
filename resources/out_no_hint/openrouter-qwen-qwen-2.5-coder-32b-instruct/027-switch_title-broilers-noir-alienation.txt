Broilers, noir, alienation
In the neon glow of the city night
Where the shadows play tricks on the light
Broilers, noir, alienation
In the heart of the concrete jungle
Where the dreams are as cold as the gun
Broilers, noir, alienation
In the eyes of the lost and the found
Where the echoes of the past resound
Broilers, noir, alienation
In the streets where the night never ends
Where the truth is a secret that bends
Broilers, noir, alienation
In the soul of the forgotten ones
Where the pain is a story that's spun
Broilers, noir, alienation
In the silence of the crowded room
Where the whispers of the dead are the tune
Broilers, noir, alienation
In the darkness where the light is a lie
Where the truth is a shadow that dies
Broilers, noir, alienation
In the heart of the broken dreams
Where the echoes of the past resound
Broilers, noir, alienation
In the neon glow of the city night
Where the shadows play tricks on the light
