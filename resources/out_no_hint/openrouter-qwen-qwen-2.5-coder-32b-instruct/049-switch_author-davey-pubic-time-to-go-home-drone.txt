Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics to "Time to Go Home" by Davey Pubic, specifically the "Drone" version. Let me start by confirming the correct song and artist. Davey Pubic is a band known for their punk rock style, and "Time to Go Home" is one of their popular tracks. The "Drone" version might be a remix or a different take on the original song.

First, I need to verify if there's an official "Drone" version of this song. Sometimes, bands release extended or remix versions with different titles. I'll check music databases and official sources to confirm. If it's a remix, the lyrics might be the same as the original but with a different instrumental arrangement. However, the user specifically mentioned "Drone," so I should look for any variations in the lyrics that might exist in that version.

Next, I'll search for the lyrics. The original "Time to Go Home" lyrics are well-known, so I can start with those. The key points in the original song include themes of leaving a party, the passage of time, and the narrator's perspective on others. The "Drone" version might have a slower tempo or a more atmospheric sound, but the lyrics are likely the same. 

I need to ensure that the lyrics provided are accurate and match the "Drone" version if there are any differences. If there are no lyrical changes, I should still present the original lyrics but note that the "Drone" version refers to the instrumental style. However, the user specified to answer only with the lyrics as text, so I should avoid adding any additional information beyond the lyrics themselves.

I'll cross-reference multiple sources to confirm the accuracy of the lyrics. Sites like Genius, AZLyrics, or the band's official website would be reliable. Once I have the correct lyrics, I'll present them in a clear, formatted way without any extra commentary or structure, as per the user's instructions. It's important to make sure there are no typos or errors in the lyrics provided.
