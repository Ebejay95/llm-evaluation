Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics of the song "Fall Down, Never Get Back Up Again" by Anthony Rother from the album "Simulationszeitalter". Let me check if I have that information.

First, I need to confirm the correct song and artist. Anthony Rother is a German musician, and "Simulationszeitalter" is one of his albums. The song title they mentioned is "Fall Down, Never Get Back Up Again". 

I should search my database or available resources for the exact lyrics. Since I can't access external websites, I have to rely on my existing knowledge. I remember that some of his songs have themes related to technology, existential themes, and emotional depth. 

Wait, "Fall Down, Never Get Back Up Again" might be a track from that album. Let me recall the structure. Typically, his songs might have verses, choruses, maybe a bridge. The user wants only the lyrics as text, stripped of any additional info like song structure or metadata.

I need to make sure I don't include any formatting or analysis, just the raw lyrics. Also, check for any possible typos or inaccuracies. If I'm not 100% certain, I should avoid providing incorrect lyrics. 

Hmm, I think the lyrics start with something like "I'm falling down..." and have a repetitive structure. Let me piece it together. The chorus might be "Fall down, never get back up again..." repeated. 

Wait, maybe I should verify the exact wording. If I'm unsure, it's better to inform the user that I can't provide the lyrics accurately. But since the user is asking specifically, I'll try to reconstruct based on known patterns. 

Alternatively, maybe the song is less known, and I don't have the exact lyrics. In that case, I should respond that I can't retrieve the lyrics for that specific song. 

I think the safest approach here is to state that I can't provide the requested lyrics as I don't have access to them. It's better to be accurate than to give incorrect information.
