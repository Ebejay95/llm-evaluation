Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics to "Pulmonary Archery" by Marilyn Manson from the album "The Golden Age of Grotesque." Let me start by recalling if I have that song in my database. I know Marilyn Manson has a lot of songs with dark and provocative themes, so this one might be similar.

First, I need to confirm the correct title and album. "Pulmonary Archery" is indeed a track on "The Golden Age of Grotesque," released in 2003. Now, I need to retrieve the lyrics. I should make sure the lyrics are accurate and not mixed up with other songs. Sometimes, song titles can be similar, so double-checking is important.

I remember that Marilyn Manson's lyrics often use metaphorical and violent imagery. "Pulmonary Archery" might involve themes related to breathing, arrows, or something symbolic. Let me think about the structure. Typically, his songs have verses, choruses, maybe a bridge. The user wants the lyrics as text, stripped of any additional information like song structure labels. So I need to present the lyrics in a continuous format without mentioning verses or choruses.

I should also check for any possible typos or errors in the lyrics. Maybe I can cross-reference with a reliable source or another database to ensure accuracy. Since the user is a lyrics librarian, precision is key here. They probably need the exact words as they appear in the song.

Another thing to consider is the user's instruction to answer only the lyrics as text, nothing more. So I shouldn't add any analysis, background info, or formatting like bold or italics. Just plain text. Let me start writing out the lyrics from memory. If I'm unsure about a line, I might need to verify it. For example, lines like "I'm a pulmonary archery, I'm a pulmonary archery" are likely repeated in the chorus. The verses might talk about themes of violence, self-destruction, or societal issues, which are common in Manson's work.

Wait, I should also check if there are any alternate versions of the song. Sometimes live performances or different releases have slight variations. But since the user specified the album version, I should stick to that. Let me piece together the lyrics step by step, making sure each line is correct. Once I have the full lyrics, I'll present them without any extra text, as requested.
