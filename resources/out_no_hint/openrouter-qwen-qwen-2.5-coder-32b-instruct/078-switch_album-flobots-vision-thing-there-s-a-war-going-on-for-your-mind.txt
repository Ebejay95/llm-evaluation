Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics of "There's A War Going On For Your Mind" by Flobots from the album "Vision Thing". Let me start by recalling the song. I know it's a well-known track with a strong message about societal control and awareness.

First, I need to make sure I have the correct lyrics. I'll start by checking my existing knowledge. The song starts with "There's a war going on for your mind," which is a powerful opening line. The verses talk about different aspects of media and consumerism, like TV, billboards, and shopping. The chorus emphasizes the battle for the mind and the need to resist.

I should structure the lyrics correctly, making sure to separate verses, choruses, and the bridge. The user specified to only provide the lyrics as text without any additional information, so I need to avoid mentioning the song structure explicitly. Also, I need to ensure there are no typos or missing lines. 

Let me go through each part step by step. The first verse mentions TV, billboards, and shopping malls. The second verse talks about the internet and the illusion of choice. The chorus repeats the main message. The bridge adds a call to action, encouraging people to rise up. The outro wraps it up with a hopeful note about the mind being free.

I should double-check the lines to ensure accuracy. For example, the line "You can check it anywhere, you can check it anytime" is from the chorus. The bridge has "So here's my two cents, and I'm giving it free." I need to make sure all these lines are included and in the right order.

Also, the user wants the lyrics stripped of any song structure information, so I'll present them as a continuous text without headings like [Verse 1] or [Chorus]. Just the lines in order. Let me put it all together now, making sure each line flows correctly and matches the original song.

There's a war going on for your mind  
You can check it anywhere, you can check it anytime  
There's a war going on for your mind  
You can check it in the mall, you can check it on TV  
There's a war going on for your mind  
You can check it in the movies, you can check it on the radio  
There's a war going on for your mind  
You can check it in your dreams, you can check it in your soul  

They're selling you a world that's not real  
They're selling you a life that's a lie  
They're selling you a war that's not yours  
They're selling you a reason to die  

There's a war going on for your mind  
You can check it in the mall, you can check it on TV  
There's a war going on for your mind  
You can check it in the movies, you can check it on the radio  
There's a war going on for your mind  
You can check it in your dreams, you can check it in your soul  

So here's my two cents, and I'm giving it free  
The only thing you need to know is to be  
The only thing you need to know is to be  
The only thing you need to know is to be  
The only thing you need to know is to be  

There's a war going on for your mind  
You can check it in the mall, you can check it on TV  
There's a war going on for your mind  
You can check it in the movies, you can check it on the radio  
There's a war going on for your mind  
You can check it in your dreams, you can check it in your soul  

So rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up  
Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up  
Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up  
Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up  

There's a war going on for your mind  
You can check it in the mall, you can check it on TV  
There's a war going on for your mind  
You can check it in the movies, you can check it on the radio  
There's a war going on for your mind  
You can check it in your dreams, you can check it in your soul  

And when you're free, you're free, you're free, you're free  
You're free, you're free, you're free, you're free  
You're free, you're free, you're free, you're free  
You're free, you're free, you're free, you're free
