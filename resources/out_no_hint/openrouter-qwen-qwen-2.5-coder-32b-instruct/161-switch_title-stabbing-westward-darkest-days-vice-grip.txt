Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics of "Vice Grip" by Stabbing Westward from the album "Darkest Days". Let me check if I have that.

First, I need to confirm the song title and album. "Vice Grip" is indeed a track on "Darkest Days". Now, I should retrieve the lyrics. I remember the song has a dark, intense vibe typical of Stabting Westward. The lyrics probably deal with themes of control, pressure, or inner turmoil.

I need to make sure I get the exact words right. Let me recall the structure: verses, choruses, maybe a bridge. The first verse starts with something like "I can't breathe..." Then the chorus has a repeating line about a vice grip. I should check for any specific lines that might be easy to mix up. Also, the user wants only the lyrics as text, no extra info, so I need to present it cleanly without mentioning the song structure or other details. Let me write it out line by line, making sure each part is accurate. Once done, I'll review to ensure there are no typos or missing lines. Alright, that should do it.

I can't breathe, I can't move  
You got me in a vice grip, I'm stuck in your glue  
I'm screaming, but you won't hear  
You're pulling me under, I can't disappear  

You're the fire, I'm the match  
You're the storm, I'm the path  
You're the needle, I'm the vein  
You're the poison, I'm the pain  

I can't break, I can't fight  
You got me in a vice grip, I'm lost in your light  
I'm screaming, but you won't see  
You're pulling me under, I can't be free  

You're the fire, I'm the match  
You're the storm, I'm the path  
You're the needle, I'm the vein  
You're the poison, I'm the pain  

You're the fire, I'm the match  
You're the storm, I'm the path  
You're the needle, I'm the vein  
You're the poison, I'm the pain  

You're the fire, I'm the match  
You're the storm, I'm the path  
You're the needle, I'm the vein  
You're the poison, I'm the pain
