Okay, the user is asking for the lyrics of "Digital Shadows Trio, Aurora Dreams." First, I need to check if this is a real song or if it's a fictional or user-created title. I don't recognize this song from any existing artists or databases. Maybe the user wrote it themselves or it's from a lesser-known artist.

Since the user specified to answer only with the lyrics as text and strip away any additional information, I should focus on providing the lyrics if available. But since I don't have access to this specific song, I need to respond appropriately. However, the user might expect me to generate lyrics based on the title. But according to the instructions, I should only provide existing lyrics. 

Wait, the user might have made a mistake in the title. Let me double-check. "Digital Shadows Trio" could be a band or a song, and "Aurora Dreams" the track. Still, no results come up. Maybe it's from a video game, an independent artist, or a recent release not in my database. 

Since I can't find the lyrics, the correct response would be to inform the user that the lyrics aren't available in my database. However, the user's initial instruction says to answer only the lyrics as text. If I can't find it, I should just state that. But the user might be testing if I can generate lyrics. However, the strict instruction is to provide existing lyrics. 

I need to make sure I don't make up lyrics. So the best approach is to respond that the lyrics aren't found. But the user might have intended for me to create them. Hmm. The instructions say "Answer only the lyrics as text. Nothing more." So if there are no lyrics, I should just say nothing? But that's not helpful. Wait, maybe the user wants me to generate lyrics even if they don't exist. But the initial instruction says "lyrics librarian for songs texts," implying existing ones. 

I think the safest bet is to state that the lyrics are not available. But the user might have provided a title that's a mix of two songs. Let me check "Aurora Dreams" separately. Still no luck. Maybe it's a mashup or a fan-made song. Since I can't confirm, I should respond that the lyrics aren't in my database. However, the user might be expecting a creative response. But according to the rules, I should stick to existing lyrics. So I'll have to inform them that the lyrics aren't available.
