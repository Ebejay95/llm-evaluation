I wanna leave them all behind
Cut my ties, say my goodbyes
I packed my bags, walked out the door
I don't want this life no more

I wanna leave them all behind
All the pain, all the lies
I'm breaking free from these chains
I don't want this life no more

I'm gonna leave them all behind
Start fresh, make a new life
I'm spreading my wings, taking flight
I don't want this life no more

I wanna leave them all behind
Burn the bridges to the ground
I'm moving on, I'm unbound
I don't want this life no more
