In the white room, shadows crawl
Echoes of your voice down the hall
Silent screams, I hear them all
In this white room, I'm ten feet tall

Feeling like a stranger in my skin
Lost in the echo, drowning within
In this white room, where do I begin?
In this white room, where do I begin?

Got these scars, etched in my soul
In this white room, I'm losing control
Your memory's a poison, a toll
In this white room, I'm not whole

I'm screaming out, can't you hear?
In this white room, full of fear
Your ghost is still here, so clear
In this white room, I can't steer

Out of the shadows, into the light
I'm breaking free, with all my might
In this white room, putting up a fight
In this white room, I'm ignited.
