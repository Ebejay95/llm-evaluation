Walking down the street, dragging my feet
I saw a car, I couldn't help but weep
She was sitting there, with that long blonde hair
I couldn't help but stare, at her underwear

I said come down, from the hills
Come down and make my baby
Come down, from the hills
Come down and make my baby

She said I can't, I'm busy tonight
I said come on, it doesn't feel right
She said I can't, I'm busy my friend
I said come down, again and again

I said come down, from the hills
Come down and make my baby
Come down, from the hills
Come down and make my baby

She said I can't, I'm busy tonight
I said come on, it doesn't feel right
She said I can't, I'm busy my friend
I said come down, again and again

I said come down, from the hills
Come down and make my baby
Come down, from the hills
Come down and make my baby
