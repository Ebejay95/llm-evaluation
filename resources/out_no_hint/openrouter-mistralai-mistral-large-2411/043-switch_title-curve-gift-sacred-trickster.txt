In the curve of your embrace
I find a place that's safe
A hiding place, a sacred space

You are the gift that I receive
A blessing that I can't believe
A trickster who's found his way into my heart

In the curve of your smile
I see the tricks that you've played all the while
But I don't care, I'm under your spell

You are the gift, the sacred trickster
The one who makes my heart beat just a little bit quicker
And I won't let go, of this feeling, oh no
