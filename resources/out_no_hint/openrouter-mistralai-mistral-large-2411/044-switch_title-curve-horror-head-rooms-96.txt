In rooms 96 and 97, I saw my soul
Written on the wall, written on the floor
In blood and tears and things I can't be sure
I've got to get out, I've got to get out

I've got to get out of 96 and 97
I've got to get out, I've got to get out
I've got to get out of 96 and 97
I've got to get out, I've got to get out

I saw my soul
I saw my soul
I saw my soul
I saw my soul

In rooms 96 and 97, I saw my soul
Written on the wall, written on the floor
In blood and tears and things I can't be sure
I've got to get out, I've got to get out

I've got to get out of 96 and 97
I've got to get out, I've got to get out
I've got to get out of 96 and 97
I've got to get out, I've got to get out

I saw my soul
I saw my soul
I saw my soul
I saw my soul
