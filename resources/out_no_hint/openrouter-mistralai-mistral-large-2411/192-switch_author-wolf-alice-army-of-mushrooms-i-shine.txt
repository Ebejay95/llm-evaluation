I shine in the dark
I glow when it's black
You never see my spark
But you feel my attack

I'm in the corner
I'm in the trick of your mind
I'm in the shadow
I'm in the nothing you'll find

We are the army
Of the mushrooms they crush
We are the ghosts
Of the soldiers you hush

I'm in the corner
I'm in the trick of your mind
I'm in the shadow
I'm in the nothing you'll find

I shine in the dark
I glow when it's black
You never see my spark
But you feel my attack
