Woke up today, the world was calm.
I thought I'd call you up, stretch out my arm.
But the telephone just rang and rang.
Your friends said you'd gone, wasn't that strange?

I walked downtown, to your front door.
Just a pile of junk, nothing more.
The neighbors said you'd gone away.
But they wouldn't say where, or even the day.

I went to the places we used to go.
But I couldn't find you, couldn't let it show.
Your face, your voice, your shadow burn.
Each night I pray, you'd never return.

I'll search forever, in every zone.
Till I find you, in the shadow zone.
I'll search forever, till the end of time.
Till I hold you, and I make you mine.
