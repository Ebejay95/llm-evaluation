I don't want to be your curve
I don't want to be your line
I don't want to be your straight or your circle
I don't want to be your sign

I don't want to be your hold
I don't want to be your key
I don't want to be your black or your colour
I don't want to be your see

I don't want to be
I don't want to be

I don't want to be your curve
I don't want to be your line
I don't want to be your straight or your circle
I don't want to be your sign

I don't want to be your hold
I don't want to be your key
I don't want to be your black or your colour
I don't want to be your see

I don't want to be
I don't want to be
