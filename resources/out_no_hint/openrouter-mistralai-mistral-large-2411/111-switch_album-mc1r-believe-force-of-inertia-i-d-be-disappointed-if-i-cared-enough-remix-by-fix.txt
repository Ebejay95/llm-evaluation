I'm not afraid anymore
All your threats have become a bore
I've heard it all before
You can't tell me anything I don't already know

You think you're above
But you're just another shove
I won't fall, I won't fold
Your words are cold and old

I believe in myself
I don't need your wealth
I'll make it on my own
Your seeds of doubt won't be sown

The force of inertia
Won't hold me back anymore
I'm breaking free
From your constant need to control me

I'd be disappointed
If I cared enough to be
But I've let go of your expectations
I'm living my life, making my own creations.
