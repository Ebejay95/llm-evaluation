I can't help but feel I'm drowning
In a whispering silence that's deafening
I can't help but feel I'm lonely
In a crowded room where no one hears me crying out

I'm calling, I'm calling, I'm calling out
Somebody hear my voice
I'm calling, I'm calling, I'm calling out
Somebody hear my voice

I can't help but feel I'm falling
Into an endless sea of hopelessness
I can't help but feel I'm fading
Into the darkness that's surrounding me

I'm calling, I'm calling, I'm calling out
Somebody hear my voice
I'm calling, I'm calling, I'm calling out
Somebody hear my voice

I can't help but feel I'm dying
In a world that doesn't care if I'm alive or dead
I can't help but feel I'm crying
In a whispering silence that's deafening

I'm calling, I'm calling, I'm calling out
Somebody hear my voice
I'm calling, I'm calling, I'm calling out
Somebody hear my voice

I can't help but feel I'm nothing
In a world that doesn't see the emptiness I feel inside
I can't help but feel I'm somewhere
In between the living and the dead

I'm calling, I'm calling, I'
I'm calling, I'm calling, I'm calling out
Somebody hear my voice
I'm calling, I'm calling, I'm calling out
Somebody hear my voice.
