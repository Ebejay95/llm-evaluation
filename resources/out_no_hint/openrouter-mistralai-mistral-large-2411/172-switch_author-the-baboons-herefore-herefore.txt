In a land where the sun never shines
There's a place that I call mine
Down in the valley, over the hill
There's a spot that's peaceful and still

Got a heart that's been broken in two
Got a mind that's always on you
But I know that I'll see you again
When the baboons start to sing in the rain

Herefore, herefore, the baboons sing
In the rain, in the rain, in the rain
Herefore, herefore, the baboons sing
In the rain, in the rain, in the rain

In a world full of sadness and strife
I'm just looking for a better life
Got a dream that I hold on to
And a love that I'll always pursue

Herefore, herefore, the baboons sing
In the rain, in the rain, in the rain
Herefore, herefore, the baboons sing
In the rain, in the rain, in the rain

So here's to the dreams that we share
And the love that's always been there
When the baboons sing in the rain
I know that I'll see you again

Herefore, herefore, the baboons sing
In the rain, in the rain, in the rain
Herefore, herefore, the baboons sing
In the rain, in the rain, in the rain.
