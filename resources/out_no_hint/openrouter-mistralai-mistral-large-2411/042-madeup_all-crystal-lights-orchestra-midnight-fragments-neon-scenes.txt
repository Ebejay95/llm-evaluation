In the heart of the city, under neon lights
Shadows dance and secrets take to flight
Midnight fragments, echoes of the day
In the cold and distant, quietly they lay

Streets are silent, but the memories scream
In this concrete jungle, lost in a dream
Broken whispers, shattered on the ground
In the noise and chaos, nothing can be found

The clock ticks onward, time refuses to wait
For the souls adrift, navigating their fate
Through the alleys dark, and the avenues wide
In the city's heart, they confide and they hide

But when the sun rises, and the dawn breaks clear
All the ghosts of night, silently disappear
Leaving only echoes, traces in the air
Of the midnight fragments, and the dreams they bear
