In a world that's lost its light
I'm screaming out to find an end
A hope, a dream, a faded sight
I'm chasing dreams that won't begin

I'm bleeding out, I'm bleeding in
I'm searching for a helping hand
I'm screaming out, I'm screaming in
I'm losing grip on who I am

I'm chasing dreams that won't begin
I'm searching for a helping hand
I'm losing grip on who I am
I'm screaming out to find an end

In this world of endless pain
I'm searching for my own deliverance
I'm chasing dreams that won't begin
I'm losing grip on who I am

I'm bleeding out, I'm bleeding in
I'm searching for a helping hand
I'm screaming out, I'm screaming in
I'm losing grip on who I am

In this world of endless pain
I'm searching for my own deliverance
I'm chasing dreams that won't begin
I'm losing grip on who I am

I'm bleeding out, I'm bleeding in
I'm searching for a helping hand
I'm screaming out, I'm screaming in
I'm losing grip on who I am.
