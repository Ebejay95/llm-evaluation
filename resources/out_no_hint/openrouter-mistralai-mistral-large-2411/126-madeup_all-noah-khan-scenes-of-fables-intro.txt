In a world that's lost its color, where the dark shades reign,
I search for truths unspoken, in the whispers of the slain.
Through the echoes of the past, and the shadows in between,
I wander through the fables, in the scenes that are unseen.

In the heartache and the sorrow, in the love that's turned to rust,
I find the tales of heroes, who have fallen to the dust.
With their dreams that have been shattered, and their hopes that have been burned,
I piece together stories, from the lessons they have learned.

So come with me, dear traveler, let us journey through the night,
Through the remnants of these fables, we shall find the morning light.
For within the darkest corners, where the fears of men take root,
There's a magic hidden silently, in the unseen, absolute.
