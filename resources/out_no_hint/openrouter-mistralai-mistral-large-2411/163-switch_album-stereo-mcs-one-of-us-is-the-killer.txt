I see you walking down the street
You got your head held high
You got a certain kind of beat
A rhythm that catches my eye
You got your mind made up
You got your plans laid out
You got your hands held up
You got your mouth shout
You got your back to the wall
You got your feet on the ground
You got your heart in a sling
You got your head in a cloud
You got your way of thinking
You got your way of talking
You got your way of walking
You got your way of stalking
You got your way of working
You got your way of shirking
You got your way of living
You got your way of giving
You got your way of loving
You got your way of hating
You got your way of creating
You got your way of destroying
You got your way of winning
You got your way of sinning
You got your way of hiding
You got your way of finding
You got your way of losing
You got your way of choosing
You got your way of holding
You got your way of folding
You got your way of dancing
You got your way of romancing
You got your way of fighting
You got your way of uniting
You got your way of dividing
You got your way of providing
You got your way of healing
You got your way of feeling
You got your way of seeing
You got your way of being
You got your way of knowing
You got your way of showing
You got your way of growing
You got your way of sowing
You got your way of reaping
You got your way of keeping
You got your way of seeking
You got your way of speaking
You got your way of taking
You got your way of making
You got your way of breaking
You got your way of shaking
You got your way of moving
You got your way of proving
You got your way of doing
You got your way of undoing
You got your way of playing
You got your way of saying
You got your way of meaning
You got your way of dreaming
You got your way of hoping
You got your way of coping
You got your way of dealing
You got your way of feeling
You got your way of thinking
You got your way of drinking
You got your way of smiling
You got your way of beguiling
You got your way of loving
You got your way of hating
