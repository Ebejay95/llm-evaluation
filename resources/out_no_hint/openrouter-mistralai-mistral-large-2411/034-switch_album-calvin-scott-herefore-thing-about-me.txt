I got a heart full of secrets, hands in my pockets
Guess I'm just another product of
Everything I've ever been through
Got some scars and a story, got some whiskey in my glass
Got something to prove

I've been burned, I've been broken
But I'm not afraid to bleed
'Cause I've learned how to turn
All my pain into strength that I need

There's a thing about me, I'm just tryna be
The man that I see, in my dreams
So don't try to change, don't try to tame
This heart that's beatin' like a drum in a cage

I've been lost, I've been lonely
But I always find my way
'Cause I've learned how to turn
All my tears into rivers that sway

There's a thing about me, I'm just tryna be
The man that I see, in my dreams
So don't try to change, don't try to tame
This heart that's beatin' like a drum in a cage

I've been told, I've been shattered
But I always find a way
To turn all my scars, into stars that pave
The road that will lead me right out of this place

There's a thing about me, I'm just tryna be
The man that I see, in my dreams
So don't try to change, don't try to tame
This heart that's beatin' like a drum in a cage

I got a heart full of secrets, hands in my pockets
Guess I'm just another product of
Everything I've ever been through
Got some scars and a story, got some whiskey in my glass
Got something to prove
