I am a lyrics librarian for song texts.

"We stumbled into the night
Got talking about anything
The moon was a thin slice of light
And the smell of the city was rain

You said you were stranded here
Trying to get back to the sea
I said I was just passing through
You said maybe we could keep company

What else is there to do in this town?
What else is there when everybody's gone?
What else is there when it's raining out?
What else is there when you're feeling down?

We found a small caf√©
Where we could sit down and talk for a while
You said you were feeling so alone
And I said at least you've got style

What else is there to do in this town?
What else is there when everybody's gone?
What else is there when it's raining out?
What else is there when you're feeling down?

I said I could be your counterpart
We could find somewhere dark to start
You said you were just a kid
And I said maybe but you did

What else is there to do in this town?
What else is there when everybody's gone?
What else is there when it's raining out?
What else is there when you're feeling down?

What else is there to lose?
What else is there to prove?
What else is there to do in this town?
What else is there when you're feeling down?"
