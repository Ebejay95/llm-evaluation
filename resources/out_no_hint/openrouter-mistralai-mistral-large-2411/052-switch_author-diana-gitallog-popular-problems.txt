I'm here to try
I'm pouring myself a drink
The night is hot and so am I
The breeze is blowing in from where
The boats are tied up to the pier
The moon is dumb, it cannot talk
The streets are full, the sidewalks walk
I'm leveling the distance
Between your body and my tongue

I'm going to be there when the war is over
I'm going to be there when the war is over

I'm going to be there when the morning comes
When the morning comes, I'll be there
I'll be there without a doubt
I'll be there when the morning comes
I'll be there when the morning comes
I'll be there without a doubt
I'll be there when the morning comes
When the morning comes, I'll be there

Did you ever hear a Jewish joke
Waiting to be told
In a Florentine bar
By a Polish Jew
So now you know

I'm going to be there when the war is over
I'm going to be there when the war is over

I'm going to be there when the morning comes
When the morning comes, I'll be there
I'll be there without a doubt
I'll be there when the morning comes
I'll be there when the morning comes
I'll be there without a doubt
I'll be there when the morning comes
When the morning comes, I'll be there

The river's going to rise
The wind is going to blow
The crickets are crazy
The moon is a sliver of spite

I'm going to be there when the war is over
I'm going to be there when the war is over

I'm going to be there when the morning comes
When the morning comes, I'll be there
I'll be there without a doubt
I'll be there when the morning comes
I'll be there when the morning comes
I'll be there without a doubt
I'll be there when the morning comes
When the morning comes, I'll be there
