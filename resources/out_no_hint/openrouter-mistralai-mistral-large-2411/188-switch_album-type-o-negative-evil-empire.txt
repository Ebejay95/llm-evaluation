I've lived a thousand lifetimes
All been wasted on you
A thousand times I've forgiven
All your thoughtless cruel words
And foolish pride

I've built an evil empire
From my molding flesh and blood
And when I'm gone
It will stand
A monument to pain

I've got a graveyard personality
Cemetery drive-in style
And this is my
This is my evil empire

I've lived a thousand lifetimes
All been wasted on you
A thousand times I've forgiven
All your thoughtless cruel words
And foolish pride

I've built an evil empire
From my molding flesh and blood
And when I'm gone
It will stand
A monument to pain

I've got a graveyard personality
Cemetery drive-in style
And this is my
This is my evil empire

I've got a graveyard personality
Cemetery drive-in style
And this is my
This is my evil empire

I've got a graveyard personality
Cemetery drive-in style
And this is my
This is my evil empire
