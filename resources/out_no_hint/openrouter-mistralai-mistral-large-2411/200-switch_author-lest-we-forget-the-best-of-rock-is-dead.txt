I'm stripped of all I've had before
Forgot my name and who I was
Now you see me crawling on the floor
I'm just a shadow of the man I used to be
Rock is dead
Rock is deader than dead
Shock is all in my head
What you singing for?
What you singing for?
Rock is dead
Rock is deader than dead
Shock is all in my head
Your song is
Your song is over man
I'm sick of all my heroes
They all seem so insincere
Their value systems scare me
They sell out every other year
Rock is dead
Rock is deader than dead
Shock is all in my head
What you singing for?
What you singing for?
Rock is dead
Rock is deader than dead
Shock is all in my head
Your song is
Your song is over man
Don't ask me why I'm crying
The pain is more real every day
I'm still believing
Believing it's all going to change
