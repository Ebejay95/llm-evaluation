I'll wait here for you
In the shadows of the night
I'll wait for you
I'll wait for you

The hardest part is night time
The hardest part is here alone
The hardest part is knowing
That you're out there on your own

I'll wait here for you
In the shadows of the night
I'll wait for you
I'll wait for you

The hardest part is night time
The hardest part is here alone
The hardest part is knowing
That you're out there somewhere on your own

I'll wait here for you
In the shadows of the night
I'll wait for you
I'll wait for you

The hardest part is night time
The hardest part is here alone
The hardest part is knowing
That you're out there somewhere on your own

The hardest part is night time
The hardest part is here alone
The hardest part is knowing
That you're out there somewhere on your own
