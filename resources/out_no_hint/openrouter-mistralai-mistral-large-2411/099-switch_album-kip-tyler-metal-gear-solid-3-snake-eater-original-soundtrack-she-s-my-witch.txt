She's got witchcraft, witchcraft
Witchcraft all over me
She's got witchcraft, witchcraft
Witchcraft all over me

She's got the eyes, she's got the nose
She's got the clothes, she's got the toes
She's got the witchcraft, all over me

She's got a heart, she's got a soul
She's got control, she's got the toll
She's got the witchcraft, all over me

She's got the power, she's got the spell
She's got the story, she's got the yell
She's got the witchcraft, all over me

She's got witchcraft, witchcraft
Witchcraft all over me
She's got witchcraft, witchcraft
Witchcraft all over me.
