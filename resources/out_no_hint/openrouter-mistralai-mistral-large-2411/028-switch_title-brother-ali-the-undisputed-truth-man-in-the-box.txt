I pledge allegiance to the fair and balanced
Our truth in history, the impartial
I'm just a man in a box, under locks
America, I will not fault you
Your struggle to progress is real
The things that you've done
To all of your suns
Is more than words could ever reveal
I'm just a man in a box
Trying to sock the system that silenced us
Them three strikes you invented
Is just another sick trick to enslave us
I'm just a man in a box
But not the one that you think will confine us
'Cause even though your jail cells hold our bodies
Our minds are escaping out and finding us
I'm just a man in a box
But I refuse to make an excuse
I live in here because I fought the law
And I'm a man that's been misused
I'm just a man in a box
But I'm not the one that's been abusing
My people struggling in the street
I'm just a man in a box keeping my composure
