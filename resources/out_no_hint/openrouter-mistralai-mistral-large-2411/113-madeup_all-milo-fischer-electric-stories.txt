In the heart of the city, under neon lights
We're chasing dreams, in the cold of the night
Through the echoes of the streets, we find our way
In this electric story, that starts today

We're dancing on the edge, of a distant star
Feeling the rhythm, of who we truly are
Through the shadows and the noise, we break away
In this electric story, that starts today

We won't fade, into the dark of the night
With the city lights, we'll ignite the skies
We won't lose, our electric dreams
In this city of lights, and it's neon gleams

In the heart of the city, under neon lights
We're chasing dreams, in the cold of the night
Through the echoes of the streets, we find our way
In this electric story, that starts today

So here's to the dreamers, the rebels and the free
To those who dare, to let their spirits be
This is our anthem, our electric symphony
In this city of lights, where we're meant to be

We won't fade, into the dark of the night
With the city lights, we'll ignite the skies
We won't lose, our electric dreams
In this city of lights, and it's neon gleams.
