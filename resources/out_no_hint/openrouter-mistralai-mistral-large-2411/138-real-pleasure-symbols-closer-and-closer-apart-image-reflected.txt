You've got me running in circles
Tearing my world apart
I can't take this pressure
You've got me twisted

I can't keep on living
In the shadow of your heart
I can't take this fever
You've got me shattered

I can see your face
But it's not real
I try to touch you
But I can't feel

You're an image reflected
In the shadows of my dreams
You're a memory neglected
And it's not as good as it seems

I can hear your voice
But it's not clear
I try to reach you
But you're not here

I can't keep on living
In the shadow of your heart
I can't take this fever
You've got me shattered

I can see your face
But it's not real
I try to touch you
But I can't feel

You're an image reflected
In the shadows of my dreams
You're a memory neglected
And it's not as good as it seems

I can't keep on living
In the shadow of your heart
I can't take this fever
You've got me shattered

Closer and closer apart.
