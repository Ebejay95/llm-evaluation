I glued my balls to my butthole again
Should've used some brains, should've used my brain
I glued my balls to my butthole again
Should've used some brains, should've used my brain

I was tryin' to do somethin' in the nude
I was feelin' kinda lonely, feelin' rude
Reached for the superglue, didn't read the rules
Now I'm screamin', now I'm screamin', now I'm screamin' like a fool

I glued my balls to my butthole again
Should've used some brains, should've used my brain
I glued my balls to my butthole again
Should've used some brains, should've used my brain

Called up my mom, called up my dad
Called up my sister, told her I was sad
Called up the doctor, told him I was blue
He said, "Son, ain't nothin' nothin' I can do"

I glued my balls to my butthole again
Should've used some brains, should've used my brain
I glued my balls to my butthole again
Should've used some brains, should've used my brain.
