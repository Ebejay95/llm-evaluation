I am the remnant of a life that once was mine
A faded echo of a distant past
In this grey shelter I'm confined

For all the words that poured like rivers
From this mouth that spoke in tongues
There's nothing left to say

For all the dreams that soared to heaven
And the hopes that crashed in flames
There's nothing left to save

In this illusion of a world
Where the shadows reign
I am the echo of a voice
That once could sing

For all the love that burned like embers
In this heart that beat like drums
There's nothing left to feel

For all the words that poured like rivers
From this mouth that spoke in tongues
There's nothing left to say

For all the words that poured like rivers
From this mouth that spoke in tongues
There's nothing left to say

For broken words
