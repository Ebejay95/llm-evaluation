In paper skylines we wrote down our dreams
Incriminating hearts on innocent things
A silent whisper in the dark
A shadow cast on a broken heart

We built our castles in the clouds
Above the world where we weren't allowed
With paper armies on the ground
We lived our dreams where we couldn't be found

But the rains of time have washed away
The hopes we had, the dreams we made
Now I'm left alone in the cold
With paper skylines that can't hold

The memories fade, the colors run
The ink is smeared, the paper's undone
But in my heart, the dream is alive
In paper skylines, we'll always survive
