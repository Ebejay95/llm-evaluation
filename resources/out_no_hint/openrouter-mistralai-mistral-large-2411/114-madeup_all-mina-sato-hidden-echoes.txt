In the heart of the neon city
Underneath the cold, electric light
I was searching for a memory
A hidden echo in the night

Through the rain-soaked, crowded streets
Past the faces, blurred and unknown
I was chasing your ghost, my dear
In every shadow, in every tone

Mina Sato, where are you now?
In this labyrinth of steel and sound
I keep hearing your voice, my love
A hidden echo, underground

In the whispers of the wind
In the silence between the beats
I keep feeling your touch, my dear
In every stranger that I meet

Mina Sato, where did you go?
In this city of echoes and ghosts
I keep searching for you, my love
The one I need, the one I want the most

But the city keeps on moving
And the echoes begin to fade
I keep reaching for you, my dear
In every shadow that's been made

Mina Sato, will I see you again?
In this world or the next, my friend
I keep hoping that you're out there
And that this hidden echo will never end.
