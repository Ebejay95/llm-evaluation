Wake up way too late, the sun already set,
Live in a cardboard box, in a city of regret,
Begging for spare change, looking out for number one,
A product of the system, from which I thought I'd run.

I've got no pride, I've got no shame,
I've got no dignity, and I've got no name,
I've got no face, I never stand out in a crowd,
I've got no hope, I've got no future, I am drowning.

I'm looking for a reason, to tell me why I should,
Die for the government, and go kill for the good
Of the rich, the powerful, the ones with the gold,
Die for the government, do what you're told.

I've got no morals, I've got no brain,
I've got no future, I've got no fucking name,
I've got no reason, to keep on living this way,
I've got no future, I've got no fucking say.

I'm looking for a reason, to tell me why I should,
Die for the government, and go kill for the good

I've got no morals, I've got no brain,
I've got no future, I've got no fucking name,
I've got no reason, to keep on living this way,
I've got no future, I've got no fucking say.

I've got no future, I've got no fucking name,
