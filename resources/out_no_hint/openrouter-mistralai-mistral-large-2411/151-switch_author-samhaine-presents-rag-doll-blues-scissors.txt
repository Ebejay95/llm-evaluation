I've been your rag doll, hanging on a thin line
In your arms, baby, I've lost track of time
You cut me with your scissors, you leave me in a mess
I've been your rag doll, cleanin' up your stress

You paint me with your colors, you make me feel so bright
But then you throw your black on me, and smother out my light
I've been your rag doll, dancin' to your tune
Under your spell, baby, under the moon

You cut me with your scissors, you leave me in a mess
I've been your rag doll, cleanin' up your stress

You stitch me with your promises, you make me feel so whole
But then you rip them open again, and leave me with a hole
I've been your rag doll, bent and out of shape
In your arms, baby, I've been just an escape

You cut me with your scissors, you leave me in a mess
I've been your rag doll, cleanin' up your stress

But now I'm packin' up your scissors, and I'm puttin' on my shoes
I've been your rag doll, baby, but now I'm singin' the blues
I'm gonna dance on outta here, and find my own song
'Cause I've been your rag doll, baby, for much too long.
