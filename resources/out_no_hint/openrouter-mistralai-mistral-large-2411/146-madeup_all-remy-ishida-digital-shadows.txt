In the silence, I can hear it
Echoes of your voice, singing our old song
In the darkness, I can see it
Shadows of your face, smiling at the dawn

But you're not here, you're just a ghost
A memory that haunts me, the one I miss the most
In this digital world, you were my light
Now I'm just chasing shadows, in the coldest night

Through the pixels, through the lines of code
I'm reaching out, trying to find your soul
But you're just ones and zeros, now, my dear
A digital shadow, that's all I have here

In this silence, in this darkness
I'm calling out, but you can't hear my heart
You were my sun, my stars, my skies
Now I'm just chasing shadows, as the night passes by
