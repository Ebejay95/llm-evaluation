In the quiet of a winter's breath,
Under skies that weep in cold regret,
We wander through these fading scenes,
Lost in echoes of forgotten dreams.

The city's heartbeat pulses low,
Beneath the snow and pallid glow,
We trace the paths of ghosts unseen,
Through streets that hold the stains of sin.

The red line runs through memories lost,
A silent guide through winter's frost,
Each station stop, a tale untold,
Of lives entwined, of hearts grown cold.

In shadows cast by faded signs,
We seek refuge in familiar lines,
But every story leads us back,
To the moment when our hearts turned black.

So here's to those who dared to dream,
Whose hopes were lost in sorrow's stream,
May we find peace in fading scenes,
And learn to love what might have been.
