In a room without a door
In a world that I can't ignore
There's a dream that I keep having
And it haunts me to the core

I am shattered on the floor
In a place that I've been before
There's a ghost that I keep chasing
And it wants to even the score

I am the one that you adore
But you don't see me anymore
There's a darkness that I'm facing
And it's tearing up my core

I am the crying vessel
I am the ship without a sail
I am the tigermouth lashing
The teeth that I have bared

I am the one that you implore
But you don't see me anymore
There's a darkness that I'm facing
And it's tearing up my core

I am the selfless martyr
I am the one who won't admit
That I am the beast that's chasing
The love that I can't quit

I am the one that you ignore
But you don't see me anymore
There's a darkness that I'm facing
And it's tearing up my core

I am the crying vessel
I am the ship without a sail
I am the tigermouth lashing
The teeth that I have bared

I am the selfless martyr
I am the one who won't admit
That I am the beast that's chasing
The love that I can't quit
