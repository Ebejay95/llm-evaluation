In the golden light we dance
Through the waves that crash and roar
In the city's endless trance
We are lost, we are more

Signals in the sky
Signals in the night
Signals in the wires
Signals of the light

In the echoes of the street
In the whispers of the crowd
In the silence where we meet
We are silent, we are loud

Signals in the rain
Signals in the snow
Signals in the shadows
Signals that we know

In the echoes of the street
In the whispers of the crowd
In the silence where we meet
We are silent, we are loud

Signals in the air
Signals everywhere
Signals in the wires
Signals that we share.
