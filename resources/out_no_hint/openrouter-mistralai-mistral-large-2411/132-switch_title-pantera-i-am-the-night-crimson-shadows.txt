I am the night, stalking my prey
In the still of the dark, I will find my own way
Silent and deep, the shadows I keep
Always watching, forever seeking its feast

I am the wolf, I run alone
Through the streets of the night, I'm the ghost in the cold
I am the hunter, I am the beast
I will not die, I will not be deceased

I am the night, the Crimson Shadow strong
I am the night, silent, seeking, I roam
I am the night, I have the will to live
I am the night, the night will forever give

I am the night, I have the will to live
I am the night, the night will forever give
I am the night, I have the will to live
I am the night, the night will forever give
