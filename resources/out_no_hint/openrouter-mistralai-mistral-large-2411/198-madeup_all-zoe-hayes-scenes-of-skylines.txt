Walking down these streets again, it's like nothing's changed
The memories they come back to me, like photographs that never fade
The buildings stand like giants in the cold December rain
And every face is just an echo of a feeling I can't explain

But I've been trying to find my way, been trying to find my place
In the scenes of skylines, and the shadows that they cast

The city lights, they twinkle like a thousand stars above
And I'm just one more soul, searching for a love
That's been lost and found, and lost again, like tears in the pouring rain
But I keep walking on, through the sorrow and the pain

'Cause I've been trying to find my way, been trying to find my place
In the scenes of skylines, and the shadows that they cast

The sun comes up, and the world starts over, new and clean
And I'm still here, standing tall, like a building in a dream

'Cause I've been trying to find my way, been trying to find my place
In the scenes of skylines, and the shadows that they cast
