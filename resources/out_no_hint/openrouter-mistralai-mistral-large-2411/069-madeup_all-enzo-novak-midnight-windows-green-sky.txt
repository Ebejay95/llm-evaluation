In the heart of the city, where the neon lights glow
There's a building standing tall, with secrets it bestows
At the top of the stairs, in the silence so profound
There's a room full of windows, that only open at midnight

Midnight windows, letting in the moon's soft light
Shadows dancing, in the silence of the night
I'm waiting for you, in the stillness of this place
To see your face, in the soft moon's embrace

The city's asleep, and the world seems far away
But here with you, in the moonlight, I want to stay
Through the midnight windows, under the green sky so wide
In this moment, with you, I confide

The stars are shining, like diamonds in the night
Reflecting in your eyes, oh, such a beautiful sight
As we dance together, in the silence so profound
In the room full of windows, where true love is found

So here's to the midnight windows, and the green sky above
To the quiet moments, that only we have known and loved
In the heart of the city, where the neon lights glow
There's a room full of magic, and I want the world to know
