I see your fangs in the dark
Feel your eyes on my heart
All the damn vampires
Playing forever in the night

I hear your whispers so cold
Feel your touch, it's like stone
All the damn vampires
Haunting me always, I'm alone

I wanna tame you, wanna tame you now
I wanna tame you, wanna tame you now

You live in shadows so deep
Your silence, it never sleeps
All the damn vampires
Creeping in secrets you keep

I wanna tame you, wanna tame you now
I wanna tame you, wanna tame you now

In the moonlight, we're dancing
I'm entranced in your spell
All the damn vampires
I can't escape, can't you tell?

I wanna tame you, wanna tame you now
I wanna tame you, wanna tame you now

All the damn vampires
All the damn vampires
All the damn vampires
All the damn vampires
