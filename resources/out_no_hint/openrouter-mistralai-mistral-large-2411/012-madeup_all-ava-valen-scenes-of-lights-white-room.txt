In this white room, I'll wait for you
Underneath the sycamore, our secret place
Ghosts of yesteryears, dancing in the blue
I'll keep your memories, safe in this space

In this white room, time stands still
Echoes of your laughter, paintings on the wall
If I close my eyes, I can see you still
In this white room, I give my all

Scenes of lights, dancing in the air
Your smile, your touch, your voice so fair
In this white room, I'll find you there
In my dreams, in my heart, you're always there

In this white room, I'll keep your song
Underneath the moon, under the stars above
Your melody will keep me strong
In this white room, I'll find our love
