In the corners of my room she sits and smiles
Her body grows out of the cracks in the tiles
She's in the pictures on my wall, in the shadows on the ceiling
In every single line I write, she's in every single feeling

She's in the food that I eat, in the water that I drink
In every breath of air that enters me, I breathe her in
She's in the child's eyes that watches me through the window
In the rain that lashes down, in the howling of the wind so

I've tried to wash her out of me with alcohol and soap
But she clings to every fibre like a second skin I can't be rid of her
I've tried to starve her out of me, I've tried to cut her out of me
But she's in every beat of my heart, in every cell of my body

I've tried to burn her out of me with the fire of my cigarettes
But she's in every drag I take, she's in the smoke that I exhale
I've tried to push her out of me, I've tried to vomit out of me
But she's in every heave I make, she's in the bile, she's in the pain

I've tried to fuck her out of me in the bodies of other women
But she's in every kiss I take, she's in the sweat, she's in the sin
I've tried to drive her out of me, I've tried to scream her out of me
But she's in every sound I make, she's in the echoes of the room

I've tried to drown her out of me in the rivers and the seas
But she's in every stroke I swim, she's in the waves, she's in the tide
I've tried to run her out of me, I've tried to dance her out of me
But she's in every step I take, she's in the rhythm, she's in the beat

She's in the city that I live in, she's in the streets that lead me home
She's in the people that I meet, she's in the friends that I have known
She's in the music that I listen to, she's in the colours that I see
She's in the dreams that come to haunt me in my sleep

She's in the lover that I long for, she's in the images I see
She's in the words that I need, she's in the beauty that's in me
She's in the love that touches all of us, she's in the air that we all breathe
She's in the beginning and the end of everything that we all be
