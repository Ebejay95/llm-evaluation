I never knew you
You know me so well
But I never knew you
You see me in hell
But I never knew you

I never knew you
You tell me I'm wrong
But I never knew you
You knew all along
But I never knew you

I never knew you
You said it was real
But I never knew you
You knew how I'd feel
But I never knew you

I never knew you
You said it was true
But I never knew you
I never knew you

I never knew you
You said it was right
But I never knew you
You said it was life
But I never knew you

I never knew you
You said it was me
But I never knew you
You said I was free
But I never knew you

I never knew you
You said it was good
But I never knew you
You said that you would
But I never knew you

I never knew you
You said it was love
But I never knew you
You said it was us
But I never knew you

I never knew you
You said it was fine
But I never knew you
You said it was mine
But I never knew you

I never knew you
You said it was you
But I never knew you
I never knew you.
