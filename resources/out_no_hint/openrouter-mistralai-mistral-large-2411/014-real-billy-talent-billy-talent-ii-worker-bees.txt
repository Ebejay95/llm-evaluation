I'm just another casualty, of the world that I live in.
I'm drowning in the hypocrisy, that drips from your fingertips.
You tell me that I'm free, but I can't hear my screams.
I'm just another worker bee, in your sick fucking disease.

We're just a number, yeah we're just awhore.
For the corporate master, who's always wanting more.
We're just a figure, on your balance sheet.
Another worker bee, expendable, obsolete.

You tell us to relax, everything's alright.
Just keep your mouth shut, don't put up a fight.
You tell us to be good, and follow all the rules.
But we're not your slaves, we're not your fucking tools.

We won't be manipulated, with your propaganda lies.
We won't be patronized, with the shit you've memorized.
We won't be brainwashed, by your media whores.
We won't take it anymore, we won't be ignored.

We're just a number, yeah we're just a whore.
For the corporate master, who's always wanting more.
We're just a figure, on your balance sheet.
Another worker bee, expendable, obsolete.

You can keep your fucking money, and you can keep your fucking fame.
We don't want your fucking pity, we don't want your fucking name.
We just want our freedom, we just want the truth.
We won't be your prisoner, we won't be your fucking youth.

We're just a number, yeah we're just a whore.
For the corporate master, who's always wanting more.
We're just a figure, on your balance sheet.
Another worker bee, expendable, obsolete.
