In the heart of the darkest night, I found a spark of light.
A beacon strong, a flame burning bright.
A reason to stand, a reason to fight.

I've been down and out, I've been beaten and broke.
I've been kicked to the curb, I've been lost and alone.
But I won't give up, I won't let go.
I'll find my way back, I'll find my way home.

This is my anthem, my song of hope.
My battle cry, my way to cope.
I won't be silenced, I won't be defeated.
I'll stand tall, I won't be retreated.

In the face of adversity, I'll rise above.
With the power of love, I'll conquer all.
I'll break through the walls, I'll shatter the chains.
I'll find my way back, I'll find my way home.

This is my anthem, my song of hope.
My battle cry, my way to cope.
I won't be silenced, I won't be defeated.
I'll stand tall, I won't be retreated.

So here's to the dreamers, the lost and alone.
Here's to the fighters, the ones who won't let go.
Here's to the hope that guides us through the night.
Here's to the light that leads us back home.
