In a world of shit, you stride along
With a rectifier, ditching the throng
You're a master of your own fate
With a rectifier, it's never too late

You're a man with a plan, a man with a dream
A man with a gadget, a man supreme
You've got the power, you've got the might
With a rectifier, you'll always be right

In a world of wrong, you'll be Mr. Right
With a rectifier, shining so bright
You'll be a beacon, a guiding light
In a world of darkness, shining so bright

So here's to you, with your gadget supreme
A man with a dream, in a world so mean
You'll always be right, you'll always be true
With your rectifier, shining so new.
