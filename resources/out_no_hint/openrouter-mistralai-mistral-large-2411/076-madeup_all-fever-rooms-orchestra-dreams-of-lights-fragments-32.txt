In the heart of the city, under neon lights
Shadows dance and flicker, in the endless nights
Dreams of lights, dreams of lights

Through the rain-soaked streets, echoes of the past
Memories whisper softly, fading away fast
Dreams of lights, dreams of lights

In every face, in every stranger's eyes
A story hidden, a secret in disguise
Dreams of lights, dreams of lights

But when the morning comes, and the sun begins to rise
The dreams fade away, like shadows in the skies
Dreams of lights, dreams of lights

So here's to the night, and the stars that guide us home
To the dreams that we hold, and the seeds that we've sown
Dreams of lights, dreams of lights.
