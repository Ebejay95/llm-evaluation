I am the face of your fear
The echo of your screams that you still hear
I am the pain that you feel inside
I am the voice that is eating you alive

I am your enemy, I am your friend
The poison that will never end
I am the darkness, I am the light
I am your heart that beats in the night

I am your savior, I am your death
The shadow that copyrights your breath
I am your beginning, I am your end
I am the ambition that you can't defend

I am Nemesis

I am the thunder in the pouring rain
I am the echo of your screaming pain
I am the silence that drowns your dreams
I am the devil that wakes you from your sleep

I am the face of your fear
The echo of your screams that you still hear
I am the pain that you feel inside
I am the voice that is eating you alive

I am your enemy, I am your friend
The poison that will never end
I am the darkness, I am the light
I am your heart that beats in the night

I am your savior, I am your death
The shadow that copyrights your breath
I am your beginning, I am your end
I am the ambition that you can't defend

I am Nemesis

I am the thunder in the pouring rain
I am the echo of your screaming pain
I am the silence that drowns your dreams
I am the devil that wakes you from your sleep

I am your enemy, I am your friend
The poison that will never end
I am the darkness, I am the light
I am your heart that beats in the night

I am your savior, I am your death
The shadow that copyrights your breath
I am your beginning, I am your end
I am the ambition that you can't defend

I am Nemesis

I am the thunder in the pouring rain
I am the echo of your screaming pain
I am the silence that drowns your dreams
I am the devil that wakes you from your sleep

I am Nemesis
