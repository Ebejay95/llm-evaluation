Pissing in the wind that's blowing me away
A shallow grave is calling me his friend
I look to you you know I'm not afraid
But sometimes I need shelter from the pain

I've known the misery that walks hand in hand
With this loneliness that's stronger than the dead
I've looked for hope in this world that's black
And I've prayed that there was something more than this

I've felt the hatred from those who claim they were my friends
And all the laughter from the shadows where I stand
I've seen the faces of the ones who say they understand
But they can't touch me 'cause I'm stronger than they are

I've seen the devil staring into my eyes
And I've found myself clawing at the sky
I've felt their fingers 'round my neck to choke my breath
But I stand here today stronger than death, stronger than death

I've known the misery that walks hand in hand
With this loneliness that's stronger than the dead
I've looked for hope in this world that's black
And I've prayed that there was something more than this

I've felt the hatred from those who claim they were my friends
And all the laughter from the shadows where I stand
I've seen the faces of the ones who say they understand
But they can't touch me 'cause I'm stronger than they are

I've seen the devil staring into my eyes
And I've found myself clawing at the sky
I've felt their fingers 'round my neck to choke my breath
But I stand here today stronger than death, stronger than death

I've seen the devil staring into my eyes
And I've found myself clawing at the sky
I've felt their fingers 'round my neck to choke my breath
But I stand here today stronger than death, stronger than death
