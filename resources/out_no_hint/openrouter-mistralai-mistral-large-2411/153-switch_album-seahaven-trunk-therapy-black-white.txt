I've been searching every corner of this room
For something that I know I shouldn't find
It's not the first time that I've felt this low
But it's the first time that I've felt so left behind

I've been talking to your ghost in this empty home
You're not the first love that I've tried to replace
But baby, you're the first one that I've ever known
That I can't keep hidden from my mind, or even put away

I've been sleeping in the closet, on the floor
I can't stand the thought of our bed anymore
I've been looking through some photographs I found
But all the smiles are false now, all the colors are wrong

I just want to be who I was before
I just want to be who I was before
I just want to be who I was before
I just want to be who I was before you
