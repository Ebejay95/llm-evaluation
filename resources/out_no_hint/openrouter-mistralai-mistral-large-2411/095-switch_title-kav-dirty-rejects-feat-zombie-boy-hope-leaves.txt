In the shadows where the lonely hearts reside
Echoes of the past are haunting me inside
I've been searching for a way to let you go
But every time I try, I'm pulled back to the cold

Hope leaves, and darkness grows
In this world where no one knows
The pain that I've been hiding from your view
I've been trying to find my way back to you

Through the streets where the forgotten people cry
Underneath the neon lights and the lullaby
Of the sirens singing in the night so blue
I've been chasing ghosts that always lead me back to you

Hope leaves, and shadows dance
In this twisted, lonely trance
I've been fighting for a chance to break away
But the echoes of our love are here to stay

In the mirror, I see the reflection of my sin
The memories of us are written on my skin
I've been trying to find a way to let you go
But every time I try, I'm pulled back to the cold

Hope leaves, and darkness grows
In this world where no one knows
The pain that I've been hiding from your view
I've been trying to find my way back to you.
