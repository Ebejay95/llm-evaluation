I can't wake up from this dream
It's tearing me apart
I can't escape the night
It's eating at my heart

And I won't ever see the sun
I won't ever see the light of day
These are the darkest days of my life

I can't fight this on my own
I can't make it all alone
I can't break this vice grip
That's tearing at my throat

And I won't ever feel the sun
I won't ever feel the light of day
These are the darkest days of my life

I can't scream, I can't explain
Why does it always feel like rain
I can't breathe, I can't believe
That I can't find a way to be redeemed

I won't ever see the sun
I won't ever see the light of day
These are the darkest days

I won't ever feel the sun
I won't ever feel the light of day
These are the darkest days of my life
