In the echo of the city, I can hear it in my sleep
The static of the silence, where the shadows creep
Through the neon jungle, under the electric sky
I can feel it in my spirit, like a wolf about to cry

Got the fever for the horizon, in my blood, in my bones
Like a phantom and a specter, I can feel it in my soul
Through the echoes of the nighttime, underneath the moon so bright
I can feel it in my spirit, like a wolf about to bite

In the echo of the city, I can hear it in my sleep
The static of the silence, where the shadows creep
Through the neon jungle, under the electric sky
I can feel it in my spirit, like a wolf about to cry

Got the fever for the horizon, in my blood, in my bones
Like a phantom and a specter, I can feel it in my soul
Through the echoes of the nighttime, underneath the moon so bright
I can feel it in my spirit, like a wolf about to bite

In the echo of the city, I can hear it in my sleep
The static of the silence, where the shadows creep
Through the neon jungle, under the electric sky
I can feel it in my spirit, like a wolf about to cry

Got the fever for the horizon, in my blood, in my bones
Like a phantom and a specter, I can feel it in my soul
Through the echoes of the nighttime, underneath the moon so bright
I can feel it in my spirit, like a wolf about to bite.
