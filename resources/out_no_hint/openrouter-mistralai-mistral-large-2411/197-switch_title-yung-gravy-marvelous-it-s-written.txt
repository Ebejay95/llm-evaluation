Walkin' down the street, feelin' marvelous
Baby by my side, she's lookin' scandalous
Sun is in the sky, it's feelin' fabulous
Got a smile on my face, yeah, I'm feelin' fancy, huh

I'm in the zone, leave me alone
Call my own phone, leave a message at the tone, huh
I'm in the zone, leave me alone
Call my own phone, leave a message at the tone

It's written in the stars, it's written in my code
I'm destined for the top, can't nobody stop my glow, huh
It's written in the stars, it's written in my code
I'm destined for the top, can't nobody stop my glow

Steppin' in the room, everybody stare
They see the way I move, they see my flair
They see my confidence, they see my glow
They see my energy, they wanna know

Who is that? Who is that?
Walkin' in the room, everybody turn back
Who is that? Who is that?
Walkin' in the room, everybody turn back

It's written in the stars, it's written in my code
I'm destined for the top, can't nobody stop my glow, huh
It's written in the stars, it's written in my code
I'm destined for the top, can't nobody stop my glow

I'm feelin' marvelous, I'm feelin' great
I'm feelin' fabulous, I'm feelin' fancy, huh
I'm feelin' marvelous, I'm feelin' great
I'm feelin' fabulous, I'm feelin' fancy, huh

It's written in the stars, it's written in my code
I'm destined for the top, can't nobody stop my glow, huh
