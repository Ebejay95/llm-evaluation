In the shadows of the night
We are waiting for the light
To break through the darkest skies
We are lost, we are blind

We are searching for the truth
In the echoes of the youth
We are screaming out our names
In this endless deadly game

We are dancing with the devil in the pouring rain
In this world of pain, we're going to break the chains

We are the voices of the broken and the ones left behind
We are the echoes of the words that you'll never find

We are the shadows in the corners of your mind
We are the silence when you scream and no one's by your side

We are the ones who fell apart
In the shadows of the dark
We are the ones who lost our hearts
In the shadows of the dark

We are the voices of the broken and the ones left behind
We are the echoes of the words that you'll never find

We are the shadows in the corners of your mind
We are the silence when you scream and no one's by your side

We are the ones who fell apart
In the shadows of the dark
We are the ones who lost our hearts
In the shadows of the dark

We are dancing with the devil in the pouring rain
In this world of pain, we're going to break the chains

We are the voices of the broken and the ones left behind
We are the echoes of the words that you'll never find

We are the shadows in the corners of your mind
We are the silence when you scream and no one's by your side

We are the ones who fell apart
In the shadows of the dark
We are the ones who lost our hearts
In the shadows of the dark.
