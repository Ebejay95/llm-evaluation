In the shadows of a sleepless night
I'm walking through the pouring rain
The city's heart is beating fast
But I don't feel it anymore

I'm searching for a distant light
That faded far too long ago
The echo of a memory
Is all that's left for me to hold

We're growing old beneath the weight
Of all the dreams that failed to fly
The echo of a memory
Is all that's left for me to hold
The echo of a memory
Is all that's left for me to hold

In the silence of the city's cry
I'm calling out your name again
But all that's left is alienation
And the pouring rain

We're growing old beneath the weight
Of all the dreams that failed to fly
The echo of a memory
Is all that's left for me to hold
The echo of a memory
Is all that's left for me to hold

In the shadows of a sleepless night
I'm walking through the pouring rain
The city's heart is beating fast
But I don't feel it anymore.
