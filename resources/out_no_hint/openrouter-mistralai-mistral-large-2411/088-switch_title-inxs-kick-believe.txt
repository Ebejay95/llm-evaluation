I was broken, I was shattered
Never thought it would matter
Lost and lonely, now you're gone
All of my dreams, they were shattered
All of my hopes, they were wrong

But you believed in me
You believed in me
You believed in me
You believed in me

I was empty, I was nowhere
Never thought that you'd care
Lost and lonely, now you're gone
All of my dreams, they were shattered
All of my hopes, they were wrong

But you believed in me
You believed in me
You believed in me
You believed in me

You believed in me
You believed in me
You believed in me
You believed in me
