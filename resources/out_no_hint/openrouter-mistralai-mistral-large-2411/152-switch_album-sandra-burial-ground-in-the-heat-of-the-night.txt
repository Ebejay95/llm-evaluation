In the heat of the night, I feel your eyes on me.
You're out there somewhere, watching, waiting.
I can sense your hunger, your desire, your need.
You want my body, but you can't have me.

In the heat of the night, I hear your footsteps near.
You're getting closer, but I will not fear.
I won't give in, won't let you take control.
My heart is strong, my spirit won't fold.

In the heat of the night, we play this deadly game.
You're like a vampire, every night it's just the same.
But I won't lose, I won't give in to you.
I'll fight you till the morning light breaks through.

In the heat of the night, oh, it's a burden ground.
You turn my dreams into a battleground.
But I'll stand tall, I'll face another day.
I won't give in, I won't let you take me away.

In the heat of the night, I feel your cold embrace.
You're like a shadow, haunting me, chasing.
But I won't fall, I won't give in to you.
I'll fight you till the morning light breaks through.

In the heat of the night, oh, it's a burden ground.
You turn my dreams into a battleground.
But I'll stand tall, I'll face another day.
I won't give in, I won't let you take me away.

In the heat of the night, I feel your eyes on me.
You're out there somewhere, watching, waiting.
I can sense your hunger, your desire, your need.
You want my body, but you can't have me.
