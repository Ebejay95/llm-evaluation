In the silence of the dawn, I stand alone,
Underneath the white sky, far from home.
Shadows dance and memories weave,
Echoes of the past, I can't retrieve.

Crimson horizons stretch out before,
A canvas painted with dreams of yore.
Through the mist, I search for a sign,
A beacon of hope, a light to shine.

The wind whispers secrets in its song,
Of love and loss, and where I belong.
But the answers fade as the breeze dies down,
Leaving me stranded in this ghost town.

The sun sets low, a fiery glow,
Casting shadows on the path below.
I walk along this lonely line,
Beneath the white sky, in the twilight's shine.

Stars appear, one by one,
Guiding me through the setting sun.
In the distance, a horizon burns,
A crimson promise that slowly turns.

So I'll keep walking, step by step,
With every sunrise, every sunset.
Underneath the white sky, I'll be,
Searching for the home I long to see.
