In the dark, I don't see shadows on the wall
All I need to know is how you make me feel
I'm not asking for your hand in marriage, yeah, I just wanna feel the vibe
I just wanna feel the vibe, oh

We don't need to keep it quiet, yeah, we can be a little loud
I just wanna feel your hands around me, baby, in the crowd
I'm not asking for your hand in marriage, yeah, I just wanna feel the vibe
I just wanna feel the vibe, oh

We can keep it on the low, baby, take our time
I just wanna feel your hands around me, yeah, all night
I'm not asking for your hand in marriage, yeah, I just wanna feel the vibe
I just wanna feel the vibe, oh

I just wanna cut through the noise, yeah, feel the bass in your voice
I just wanna feel your hands around me, baby, feel the noise
I'm not asking for your hand in marriage, yeah, I just wanna feel the vibe
I just wanna feel the vibe, oh

I just wanna cut through the noise, yeah, feel the bass in your voice
I just wanna feel your hands around me, baby, feel the noise
I'm not asking for your hand in marriage, yeah, I just wanna feel the vibe
I just wanna feel the vibe, oh.
