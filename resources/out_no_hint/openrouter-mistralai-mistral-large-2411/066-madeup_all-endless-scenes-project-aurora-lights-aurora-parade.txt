In the heart of the night, under aurora lights
Shadows dance and weave, in the soft moon's glow
A parade of dreams, on the northern breeze
Echoes of the past, in the stars that shine so bright

Through the endless scenes, we're searching for a sign
In the cold and dark, we're longing for the light
With every sunrise, with every setting sun
We're reaching for the stars, till our racing hearts are won

Aurora skies, paint the canvas of our hearts
In the hues of twilight, in the cold and dark
We're chasing dreams, on the winds that call our name
In this aurora parade, nothing ever stays the same

In the silence of the snow, in the whisper of the trees
We're dancing with the spirits, on the frozen winter's breeze
Through the endless scenes, through the aurora's glow
We're writing our own story, in the northern lights we know.
