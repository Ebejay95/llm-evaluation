I'm just a stranger, traveling along
In this land of shadows, where I don't belong
I'm searching for something, that I can't explain
In this world of chaos, driving me insane

Got a heart full of fury, got my soul in a sling
I'm hanging on the wire, I wanna feel something
I'm looking for an answer, in this Babylon
I'm calling out to nobody, nobody's home

Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody

I'm walking down the highway, like a ghost in the night
Got my soul in a blender, got my heart in a vice
I'm looking for a future, where I can be real
In this Babylon system, that is killing the deal

Got a heart full of fury, got my soul in a sling
I'm hanging on the wire, I wanna feel something
I'm looking for an answer, in this Babylon
I'm calling out to nobody, nobody's home

Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody

I'm just a stranger, traveling alone
In this land of shadows, that I call my home
I'm searching for something, that I can't explain
In this world of chaos, driving me insane

Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
