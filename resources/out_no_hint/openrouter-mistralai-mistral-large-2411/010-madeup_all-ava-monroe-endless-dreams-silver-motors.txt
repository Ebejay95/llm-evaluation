In a world where dreams are made of steel
I found myself behind the wheel
Silver motors, endless highways, I've been driving all day
Got your picture in my mind, words we left unspoken

Through the mirages and the heat
I see your face in every seat
In this desert of illusion, I'm lost in confusion
But I'm driving on, endless dreams, I'm chasing

Silver motors, under the moon
Too soon, the night becomes a gloom
But I keep on driving, in this endless dream

In every town, in every face
I'm just searching for your trace
But you're nowhere, and you're everywhere
Like a ghost in the backseat, you're haunting me
