I couldn't find a song titled "Clone Your Lover" by Drake, but here are some lyrics from Drake's song "God's Plan":

I been movin' calm, don't start no trouble with me
Tryna keep it peaceful is a struggle for me
Don't pull up at 6 AM to cuddle with me
You know how I like it when you loving with me
You know how I like it when you opening the
Shawty, you in love with me, don't you
I say God's plan, yeah, yeah, don't you
I can't do this on my own, ayy, no, ayy
