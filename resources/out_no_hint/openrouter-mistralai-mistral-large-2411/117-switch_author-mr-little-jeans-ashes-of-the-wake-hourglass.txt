I can't get you off my mind
I can't leave you behind
I can't live with just a trace
Of you inside my brain

I can't wash you off my skin
I can't keep from falling in
I can't help but feel this pain
Of you that's in my veins

I can't get you off my mind
I can't leave you behind
I can't live with just a trace
Of you inside my brain

I can't wash you off my skin
I can't keep from falling in
I can't help but feel this pain
Of you that's in my veins
