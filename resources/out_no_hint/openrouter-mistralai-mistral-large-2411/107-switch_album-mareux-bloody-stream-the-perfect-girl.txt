I saw her dancing on the moon
And she was playing my tune
In her heart there was a blooming flower
She was singing loud in the rain
She was releasing her pain
With a smile and a drop of tear in her eye

She was the perfect girl
In this bloody stream
She was the perfect girl
In my twisted dream

I saw her dancing in the sun
And she was playing with a gun
In her heart there was a burning fire
She was singing loud in the snow
She was releasing her glow
With a smile and a drop of tear in her eye

She was the perfect girl
In this bloody stream
She was the perfect girl
In my twisted dream

She was the perfect girl
In this bloody stream
She was the perfect girl
In my twisted dream
