Turn yourself in, you're hiding again
From the world outside, from the world of sin
You dig a hole, you dig it deep
You're in too far, you're in too far, you're in too steep

You don't owe them, anything at all
They will tear you down, baby, once you start to fall
You don't owe them, anything at all
They don't mean shit, baby, once you start to fall

In the cold light, in the blue light
You cannot hide, you cannot fight
In the cold light, in the blue light
You cannot hide, you cannot fight

You don't owe them, anything at all
They will tear you down, baby, once you start to fall
You don't owe them, anything at all
They don't mean shit, baby, once you start to fall

In the cold light, in the blue light
You cannot hide, you cannot fight
In the cold light, in the blue light
You cannot hide, you cannot fight

You don't owe them, anything at all
They will tear you down, baby, once you start to fall
You don't owe them, anything at all
They don't mean shit, baby, once you start to fall

You don't owe them, anything at all
They will tear you down, baby, once you start to fall
You don't owe them, anything at all
They don't mean shit, baby, once you start to fall.
