In the heart of the crimson scenes,
Where the shadows dance and weave,
I've been walking down this black line,
Trying to find my reprieve.

The echoes of your voice still linger,
In the hollow of my mind,
I've been chasing ghosts in the darkness,
Hoping that the past unwinds.

But the fables fade, the stories blur,
And the memories turn to gray,
I've been losing pieces of you, dear,
As the color bleeds away.

So I'll keep walking down this black line,
Until it leads me to the sea,
Where the crimson scenes can't haunt me,
And the shadows set me free.
