In the city of decayed dreams
Rusty wheels turning in the waste
Steam-powered hearts beat in time
With the gears of the machine

Electric eyes scan the horizon
Neon lights flicker and fade
Silicon circuits humming softly
In the shadows of the monoliths

We are the children of the future
Lost in the ruins of today
Searching for remnants of tomorrow
In the garbage of yesterday

Zeitmaschinen aus MÃ¼ll
Crafted from the bones of the past
Gyroscopes spinning in the darkness
Through the corridors of time

Through the shattered glass pane
Reflections of a world unseen
Mirrored images of ourselves
Echoes of a distant scream

In the silence of the night
Whispers of a forgotten song
Ghosts of memories long since faded
Haunting us as we move along

We are the echoes of the future
Caught in the loops of time
Sister Machine Gun, Metropolis
In the rhythm of the machine's rhyme.
