In the heart of the city, under neon lights
Concrete jungle echoes with endless nights
Glass and steel towers reach for the sky
But I'm just wandering, asking why

Streets are crowded, faces blur in sight
I'm just one more shadow in the endless night
Looking for something, don't know what it is
Feeling this emptiness, like an endless abyss

Skyline wandering, under moon so bright
In this city's heart, I'm just a stranger in the night
Searching for answers, calling out your name
But all I hear is echoes, everything sounds the same.
