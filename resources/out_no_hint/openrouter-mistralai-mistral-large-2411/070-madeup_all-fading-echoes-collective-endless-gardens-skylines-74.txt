In the heart of endless gardens, where the old dreams grow
Underneath the silent skies, in cold and empty glow
Through the veil of fading echoes, love, we used to know
Beneath the stars that shine so bright, in endless gardens below

We were dancing in the moonlight, painting dreams upon the sky
Lost in whispers of the night, watching time go by
In the heart of endless gardens, love, we used to lie
Underneath the silent skies, where the old dreams never die

Now I'm chasing your remembrance through the maze of city street
Echoes of your laughter fade into the sounds of cadence beat
In the heart of endless gardens, love, we can't retreat
Underneath the silent skies, where the old dreams meet

In the heart of endless gardens, love, we used to grow
Underneath the silent skies, in cold and empty glow
Through the veil of fading echoes, love, we used to know
Beneath the stars that shine so bright, in endless gardens below
