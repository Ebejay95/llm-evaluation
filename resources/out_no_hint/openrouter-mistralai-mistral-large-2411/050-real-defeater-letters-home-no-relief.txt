I've been searching all along,
But I can't find where I belong,
I've been hoping for a sign,
But I can't read between the lines,
I've been waiting for a call,
But I can't hear your voice at all,
I've been reaching out at night,
But I can't hold you in the light,
I've been dreaming every word,
But I can't say what should be heard,
I've been trying to find my way,
But I can't see beyond today,
I've been hoping for a cure,
But I can't find a reason sure,
I've been searching for a rhyme,
But I can't find one to climb,
I've been waiting for a change,
But I can't find a way to rearrange,
I've been calling out your name,
But I can't find a way to end this pain.
