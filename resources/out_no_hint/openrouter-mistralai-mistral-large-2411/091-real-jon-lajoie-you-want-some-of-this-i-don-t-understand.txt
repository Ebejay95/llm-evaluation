I don't understand, what you don't understand
I don't understand, what you don't understand
You say you don't understand, but I don't understand
What exactly you don't understand, cause I don't understand

You say you don't understand, but how can that be?
The words that I'm saying, are coming out of me
I'm speaking them clearly, I'm speaking them slow
I'm using my tongue, to form words in a row

I say one, then two, then three, then four
Then five, then six, then seven, then more
Cause that's how I talk, that's how I speak
It's not that hard, to understand me, freak

You say you don't understand, but I think you're a liar
Cause I see you nodding, and nodding's a sign
That you understand, what I'm saying
Cause if you didn't understand, you wouldn't be swaying

Your head up and down, your head up and down
Your head up and down, like a crazy clown
Clowns understand things, that's a proven fact
So don't say you don't understand, cause I think you're full of crap

I don't understand, what you don't understand
I don't understand, what you don't understand
You say you don't understand, but I don't understand
What exactly you don't understand, cause I don't understand.
