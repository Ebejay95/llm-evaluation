In the quiet of the dawn
I watch you sleeping on
Your face is turned towards the wall
I know you're leaving me

I found your letter yesterday
Beneath the pillow where you lay
Your words were cold, your words were clear
You said you couldn't stay here

The curtains dance, the morning breeze
Is whispering through the trees
The sun is warm, but there's a chill
That's settling inside me still

The echoes of our love remain
Like paper scenes that hide the stain
Of tears that fell, of dreams that died
Of all the truths we never tried
