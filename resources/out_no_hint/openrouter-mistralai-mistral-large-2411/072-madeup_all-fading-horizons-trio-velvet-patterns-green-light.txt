Walking down the cobblestone
In a haze of green light
Shadows dancing on the wall
Velvet patterns in the night

Streetlamps whisper secrets
To the ones who know their glow
Echoes of forgotten dreams
In every window, shadows grow

Chasing ghosts through alleyways
Underneath the moon so bright
Fading horizons whisper low
In the silence of the night

Memories like velvet patterns
Entwined in green light's sway
Lost in time, found in rhyme
In the quiet, fade away
