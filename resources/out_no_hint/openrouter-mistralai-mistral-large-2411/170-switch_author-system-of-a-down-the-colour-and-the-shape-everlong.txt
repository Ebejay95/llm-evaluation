I've been away for so long, imperfect by a song.

You're right, I've been living in a room without a door.

I've been away for so long,

Never really went so far.

You're right, I've been living in a room without a door.

And you'll see, I'm suddenly breaking through.

I'm suddenly seeing through.

And it's been so long,

Since I've been home.

And it's been so long,

Since I've been home.

And it's been so long,

Since I've been home.

And it's been so long,

Since I've been home.

And you'll see, I'm suddenly breaking through.

I'm suddenly seeing through.

And it's been so long,

Since I've been home.

And it's been so long,

Since I've been home.

And it's been so long,

Since I've been home.

And it's been so long,

Since I've been home.

And you'll see, I'm suddenly breaking through.

I'm suddenly seeing through.

And it's been so long,

Since I've been home.

And it's been so long,

Since I've been home.

And it's been so long,

Since I've been home.

And it's been so long,

Since I've been home.

And you'll see, I'm suddenly breaking through.

I'm suddenly seeing through.

And it's been so long,

Since I've been home.

And it's been so long,

Since I've been home.

And it's been so long,

Since I've been home.

And it's been so long,

Since I've been home.

And you'll see, I'm suddenly breaking through.

I'm suddenly seeing through.

And it's been so long,

Since I've been home.

And it's been so long,

Since I've been home.

And it's been so long,

Since I've been home.

And it's been so long,

Since I've been home.
