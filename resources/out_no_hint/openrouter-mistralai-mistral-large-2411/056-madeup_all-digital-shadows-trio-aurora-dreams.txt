In the heart of the city, under neon light
Walking through the echoes of the night
Streets are paved with dreams, broken at the seams
In this world of illusion, nothing is what it seems

Skyscrapers touch the heavens, cold and grey
Casting long shadows, where lost souls sway
Through the static of the airwaves, comes a distant cry
Aurora dreams are calling, under the darkened sky

We're chasing ghosts in the machine, electric echoes sing
Through the labyrinth of silence, waiting for the morning
In this endless sea of faces, we're searching for a sign
Drifting through the currents, lost in the divine

Aurora dreams are dancing, on the edge of the night
In the digital shadows, we find the morning light
Through the static and the noise, through the whispers in the code
We're painting dreams with stardust, on the endless open road
