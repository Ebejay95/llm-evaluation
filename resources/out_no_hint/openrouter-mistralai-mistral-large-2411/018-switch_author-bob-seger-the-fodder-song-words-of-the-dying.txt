I heard the sign of the demon,
The sound of the killer beast.
I saw the armies gathering,
To plunder from the east.
The earth did quake, the oceans woke,
The dead did rise up from the ground.
The skies did rain the crimson blood,
The poisoned arrows flew.
The cities burned, the villages fell,
The mothers and children cried.
The young men fought, the old men died,
The screams of pain rang through the night.
The dawn revealed the carnage,
The dead and dying lay.
Their final words were whispered,
Their final prayers were said.
Their final words were whispered,
Their final prayers were said.
Their final words, their final prayers,
Their final words, their final prayers.
