In the silence, I've been waiting
For the echo of your voice
Through the static, I've been hoping
That you'll make the sweetest noise

But the city's just a stranger
And the streets are full of ghosts
In the mirrors, I've been searching
For the heart that hurts the most

And the neon lights are shining
Like the stars that fill the skies
But they can't compare to the love
That I still see in your eyes

Oh, I've been driving through the city
With the shadows in my rear
Through the hollow streets and alleys
Wishing you were here

Past the factories and churches
Past the ghosts that haunt my mind
Through the silence, through the static
I've been trying to unwind

But the radio's just a whisper
And the wheels are spinning round
I've been looking for your face, love
In the echo of the sound

Oh, I've been driving through the city
Underneath the cold, cold moon
Through the neon lights and shadows
I've been singing this sad tune

And the city's just a stranger
And the streets are full of ghosts
In the mirrors, I've been searching
For the love that I need most

For the love that I need most.
