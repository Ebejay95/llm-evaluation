I've been searching for you
In every corner of my mind
Your face is like a haunting melody
That I can't erase, no I can't erase

We're dancing on the edge of time
With every whisper, with every sigh
I'm calling out your name, in every heartbeat
In every heartbeat, I'm alive

We're chasing paper waves
In the echoes of our yesterdays
Through the shadows of these empty streets
We're fading into memories

I've been reaching out for you
But you're slipping through my hands like sand
Your laughter is a ghost that I can hear
But I can't embrace, no I can't embrace

We're dancing on the edge of time
With every whisper, with every sigh
I'm calling out your name, in every heartbeat
In every heartbeat, I'm alive

We're chasing paper waves
In the echoes of our yesterdays
Through the shadows of these empty streets
We're fading into memories

We're chasing paper waves
In the echoes of our yesterdays
Through the shadows of these empty streets
We're fading into memories

We're dancing on the edge of time
With every whisper, with every sigh
I'm calling out your name, in every heartbeat
In every heartbeat, I'm alive.
