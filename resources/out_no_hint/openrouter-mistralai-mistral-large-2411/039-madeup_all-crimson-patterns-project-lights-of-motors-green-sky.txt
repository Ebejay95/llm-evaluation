In the heart of the city, where the shadows fall,
There's a crimson pattern that's written on the wall.
Neon lights and echoes, under a green sky,
Motors humming distant, as the night goes by.

Streets are paved with secrets, whispers in the air,
Lights of motors dancing, shadows everywhere.
In the cold of the evening, under the emerald glow,
Patterns shift and change, feelings ebb and flow.

Through the alleys, ghosts of memories drift,
In every corner, echoes of laughter, a gift.
Lights of motors flicker, a lullaby so sweet,
Underneath the green sky, where the lonely hearts meet.

Patterns etched in crimson, stories they unfold,
Of lives intertwining, tales yet to be told.
In the hum of the motors, in the green sky's light,
There's a beauty in the city, in the still of the night.
