In the cold embrace of twilight's union
Beneath the ancient ghosts of sky
The echoes of a thousand sunsets
Silhouettes against the starry dome

I'm searching for the words to find you
To conjure up your ghostly form
Atonement for the sins of others
And the love that you could not defend

In the cold embrace of twilight's union
Beneath the ancient ghosts of sky
The echoes of a thousand sunsets
Silhouettes against the starry dome

I'm searching for the words to find you
To conjure up your ghostly form
Atonement for the sins of others
And the love that you could not defend

Beneath the weeping willow's arms
I lay my burden down
The ghosts of autumn haunt my dreams
And whisper secrets in my ear

I'm searching for the words to find you
To conjure up your ghostly form
Atonement for the sins of others
And the love that you could not defend

In the cold embrace of twilight's union
Beneath the ancient ghosts of sky
The echoes of a thousand sunsets
Silhouettes against the starry dome
