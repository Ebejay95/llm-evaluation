I see your face on the ceiling
I see your face on the wall
I close my eyes but the feeling
Is you won't catch me if I fall

I thought that love was just a game
I thought that you were just the same
I thought my heart would never change
But you're unpredictable

I see your face in the shadows
I see your face in the light
I thought that love was just a battle
But you're unpredictable

You turn me upside down
You turn me inside out
I'm just a fool in your crown
Oh you're unpredictable

I see your face in the moonlight
I see your face in the snow
I thought that love was just a dream
But you won't let me go

I thought that love was just a game
I thought that you were just the same
I thought my heart would never change
But you're unpredictable.
