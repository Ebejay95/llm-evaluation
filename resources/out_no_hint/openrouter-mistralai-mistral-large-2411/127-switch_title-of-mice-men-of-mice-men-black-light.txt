In the silence I hear your voice,
Telling me I have no choice,
I've got these scars, I've paid the price,
Now I'm the monster you made me.

I am the echo of your past,
The shadow that you can't outcast,
You took my soul, you took my name,
Now I'm the darkness in your frame.

You can't run, you can't hide,
The black light is burning inside,
You can't fight, you can't escape,
The black light is your fate.

In the silence I hear your screams,
Shattering all your hopes and dreams,
You took my life, you took my heart,
Now I'm the echo in the dark.

You can't run, you can't hide,
The black light is burning inside,
You can't fight, you can't escape,
The black light is your fate.

Now I'm the monster in your eyes,
The echo of your cries,
You can't run, you can't hide,
The black light is burning inside.
