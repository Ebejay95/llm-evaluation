I've been searching high, and I've been searching low
For that thing that makes me tick, yeah, makes me tick
I've been all around, and I've been up and down
For that thing that makes it real, yeah, makes it real

I've been searching far, and I've been searching wide
For that thing that makes me shine, yeah, makes me shine
I've been looking hard, and I've been losing faith
For that thing that makes it right, yeah, makes it right

And I've been walking on these velvet waves
Yeah, I've been talking under velvet waves
And I've been living in these velvet days
Oh, I've been giving up these velvet ways

I've been searching high, and I've been searching low
For that thing that makes me tick, yeah, makes me tick
I've been all around, and I've been up and down
For that thing that makes it real, yeah, makes it real
