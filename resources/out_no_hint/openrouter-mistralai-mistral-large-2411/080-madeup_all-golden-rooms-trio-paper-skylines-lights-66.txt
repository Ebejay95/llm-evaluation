In the heart of the city, under neon lights
Concrete jungle, where the wild things hide
Golden rooms, towers high, in the cold night skyline
Paper dreams, floating by, like ships in the night

Echoes of laughter, shadows on the wall
Memories haunt these halls, ghosts of us all
Lights go down, the city sleeps, in the quiet glow
Midnight streets, where the lost souls go

Chasing sunsets, on the horizon's edge
Silhouettes fade, as the night takes the stage
In the haze of the twilight, under the moon's soft shine
We're dancing with shadows, in the lights of the cityscape line
