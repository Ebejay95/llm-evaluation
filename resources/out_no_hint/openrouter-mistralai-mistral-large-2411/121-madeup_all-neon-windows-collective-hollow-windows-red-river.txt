In the heart of the city, under neon lights
Where shadows dance and secrets hide in plain sight
There's a building old, with windows that glow
Each pane of glass tells a story, don't you know

Hollow windows, echoes of the past
In every reflection, memories amassed
Red river flowing, under the moon's light
Carrying whispers of old ghosts in the night

Stories of love, and stories of strife
Echoes of laughter, shadows of life
Behind each window, a tale to tell
Of those who wandered, and those who fell

The red river knows, secrets it's kept
In its steady flow, stories interwept
Hollow windows watching, silent and wise
Under neon lights, where the old building lies
