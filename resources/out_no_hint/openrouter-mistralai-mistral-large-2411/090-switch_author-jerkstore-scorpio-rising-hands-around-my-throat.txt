You're a jerkstore, so you're saying,
I'm a bitch, well, okay then,
You're with stupid, so you're stuck,
I guess you're having fun,

You say that I am crazy,
Well, I guess I'm crazy then,
You're boring, don't you know it,
I guess you're having fun,

I'm gonna tear your world apart,
I'm gonna break your heart in two,
And I don't mind,
If it's me and you,

I'm gonna tear your world apart,
I'm gonna break your heart in two,
And I don't mind,
If it's me and you,

I'm a Scorpio rising,
You can't hold me down,
I'm a Scorpio rising,
Gonna take you down,

I've got your hands around my throat,
You think you got control,
But I'm a Scorpio rising,
Gonna take you down,

I'm gonna tear your world apart,
I'm gonna break your heart in two,
And I don't mind,
If it's me and you.
