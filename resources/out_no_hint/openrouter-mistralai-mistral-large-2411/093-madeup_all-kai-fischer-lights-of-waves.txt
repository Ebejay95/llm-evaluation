Drifting away on the waves that we made
Lost in the lights under orion's shade
The stars are like diamonds that freckle the night
Their echoes resonate in your eyes so bright

We're chasing the sun as it falls from the sky
The horizon is painted with hues that defy
The darkness that follows is softened by moon's glow
In this dance of the spheres, our hearts overflow

The waves whisper secrets in rhythm so slow
Their foam kisses shore in a soft ebb and flow
We're dancing with currents that sing us their song
In this symphony played since the world was born

The sea holds our memories in bubbles below
Each one is a moment we lived and let go
They shimmer like pearls in the ocean's embrace
A string of small treasures no time can erase

So here's to the lights and the waves and the night
To the dance of the stars and the moon's gentle light
To the love that binds us, forever entwined
Like the sea and the sky, eternal, aligned.
