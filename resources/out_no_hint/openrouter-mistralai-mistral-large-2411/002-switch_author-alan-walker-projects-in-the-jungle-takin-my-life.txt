I'm walking in the jungle, I'm walking in the rain
In my heart, in my soul, gotta ease my pain
Got a drum, got a beat, got a soul, got a sound
Got a jungle in my mind, gotta find my ground

I'm searching for the rhythm, I'm searching for the rhyme
In the jungle, in the night, gotta find some time
Got a life, got a love, got a dream, got a song
In the jungle, in my heart, gotta find my home

I'm takin' my life, I'm takin' my time
In the jungle, in the night, gotta ease my mind
Got a drum, got a beat, got a soul, got a sound
In the jungle, in my heart, gotta find my ground.
