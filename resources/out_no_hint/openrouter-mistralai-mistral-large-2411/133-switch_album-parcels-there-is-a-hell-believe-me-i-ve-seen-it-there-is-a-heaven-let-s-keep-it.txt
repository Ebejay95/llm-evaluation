In the cold of the night
I was watching the stars
And I saw you
In the cold of the night
I was lost in my car
And I saw you

There is a hell
Believe me, I've seen it
There is a heaven
Let's keep it a secret

In the cold of the night
I was dancing with death
And I saw you
In the cold of the night
I was taking my last breath
And I saw you

There is a hell
Believe me, I've seen it
There is a heaven
Let's keep it a secret

And when the sun goes down
We'll be dancing in the moonlight
And when the sun goes down
We'll be dancing in the moonlight

There is a hell
Believe me, I've seen it
There is a heaven
Let's keep it a secret
