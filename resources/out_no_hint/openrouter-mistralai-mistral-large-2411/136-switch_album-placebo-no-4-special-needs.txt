I'm high, so high
Burning down the highway sky
I'm numb, so numb
Watching as the city sleeps

I've got special needs
I've got special needs
I've got special needs
I've got special needs

I'm dry, so dry
Drowning in a sea of sweat
I'm low, so low
Watching as the city sleeps

I've got special needs
I've got special needs
I've got special needs
I've got special needs

Without a hope in hell
Without a hope in hell
Without a hope in hell
Without a hope in hell

I've got special needs
I've got special needs
I've got special needs
I've got special needs
