In this room where I've cried out
All these dreams that I've gone without
I've been searching for some hope
In this place I call my home

I've been waiting for tomorrow
To come and take away my sorrow
But it never does, it never comes
I'm still waiting for my kingdom come

When will we surrender
And understand it's over
Nothing left to defend or to defeat
We're still searching for that someone to believe

In this town where I've grown old
All these dreams have turned to gold
I've been searching for some light
In this darkness that's my life

I've been waiting for tomorrow
To come and take away my sorrow
But it never does, it never comes
I'm still waiting for my kingdom come

When will we surrender
And understand it's over
Nothing left to defend or to defeat
We're still searching for that someone to believe

I've been waiting for tomorrow
To come and take away my sorrow
But it never does, it never comes
I'm still waiting for my kingdom come

When will we surrender
And understand it's over
Nothing left to defend or to defeat
We're still searching for that someone to believe.
