You close your eyes, but all you see is pain
Another day, it's just pouring rain
You try to hide, but there's nowhere to go
You're left so empty, you're left cold

You're not alone, we're all the same
We live in darkness, we live in shame
But if we stand, we stand as one
We'll shine a light on everyone

We are the echo of your past
We are the ones that you have cast
Into the shadows of your heart
We are the memories you tried to start

We are the voices in your head
We are the dreams that you have bled
We are the ghosts that fill this empire
We are the ones that will never tire

You close your eyes, but all you see is pain
Another day, it's just pouring rain
You try to hide, but there's nowhere to go
You're left so empty, you're left cold

We are the echo of your past
We are the ones that you have cast
Into the shadows of your heart
We are the memories you tried to start

We are the voices in your head
We are the dreams that you have bled
We are the ghosts that fill this empire
We are the ones that will never tire

We are the ones that will never tire
We are the ones that will never tire
