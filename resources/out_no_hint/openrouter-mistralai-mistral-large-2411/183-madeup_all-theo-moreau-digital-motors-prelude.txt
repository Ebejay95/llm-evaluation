In the heart of the city, under neon lights
I'm searching for something, in the cold of the night
Through the echoing streets, past the faces I see
I'm chasing a feeling, a dream just out of reach

The engines are humming, the circuits are bright
In this world of metal, under the moon's light
I'm racing, I'm speeding, but I'm going nowhere
In this digital world, where the hearts beat inaire

The lights are all blurring, the colors combine
I'm lost in this jungle, of circuits and shine
I'm calling, I'm crying, but no one can hear
In this digital world, that's governed by fear

The motors are screaming, the pixels are clear
I'm driving, I'm spinning, but I can't find my gear
I'm lost in this nightmare, in this never-ending race
In this digital world, where I can't find my place.
