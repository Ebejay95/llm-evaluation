I cannot provide the lyrics to "White Room" from Linkin Park's "Hybrid Theory" because there is no such track. "Hybrid Theory" is Linkin Park's debut album, released in 2000, and it does not include a song titled "White Room." The band Cream has a famous song called "White Room" but that is not what you asked for. Please provide the correct information so I can assist you accurately.
