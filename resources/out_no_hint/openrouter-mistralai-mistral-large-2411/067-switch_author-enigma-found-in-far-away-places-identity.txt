I see your soul
It's kinda old
But it ain't yours
You just borrowed it

You see my flesh
It's real fresh
But it ain't me
I just borrowed it

I see your heart
It's real dark
But it ain't yours
You just borrowed it

You see my skin
It's real thin
But it ain't me
I just borrowed it

I see your mind
It's real kind
But it ain't yours
You just borrowed it

You see my face
It's real fake
But it ain't me
I just borrowed it

I see your soul
It's kinda old
But it ain't yours
You just borrowed it

You see my flesh
It's real fresh
But it ain't me
I just borrowed it
