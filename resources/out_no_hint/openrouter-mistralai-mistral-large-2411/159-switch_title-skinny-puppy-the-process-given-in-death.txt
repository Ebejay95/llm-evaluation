I've been given in death
A piece of someone's life
A piece of someone's trust
Cut away with your knife

I've been taken inside
A piece of someone's strife
A piece of someone's lust
Stolen dreams in the night

I've been broken in two
A piece of someone's fear
A piece of someone's truth
Echoes only I hear

I've been taken apart
A piece of someone's game
A piece of someone's heart
Lost my soul in your flame
