Lost souls in the echo chamber
A silent face in the crowd
A whispering voice in the dark
A distant echo of sound

I'm falling through the loop again
I'm calling out your name
I'm falling through the loop again
Will someone stop the rain?

The world is spinning faster now
The colours blend into one
The echo chamber's calling me
The silence has begun

I'm falling through the loop again
I'm calling out your name
I'm falling through the loop again
Will someone stop the rain?

The echo chamber's calling me
The silence has begun
The world is spinning faster now
The colours blend into one

I'm falling through the loop again
I'm calling out your name
I'm falling through the loop again
Will someone stop the rain?
