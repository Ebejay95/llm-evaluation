I've got a bad feeling about this
Like I'm betting big on a blind guess
You've got a strange look in your eye
Like you're waiting for me to break or mess this up somehow

I've seen more spine in jellyfish
I've seen more guts in 11-year-old kids
Have another drink and drive yourself home
I hope there's something that you're hoping for that you will never know

I've got a bad feeling about this
