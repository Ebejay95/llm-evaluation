In the quiet of the morning, before the day begins
I wake up to the sunrise, and the distant roar within
The city is a canvas, painted with the hopes and dreams
Of people moving forward, or so it always seems

The buildings touch the heavens, under skies so wide and blue
Each one has a story, each one has a view
Of the streets below where lifebloom, and the rivers meet the sea
In this concreate jungle, as wild and free as can be

And in the heart, the city beats, with rhythm strong and sure
A symphony of echoes, of lives that will endure
Through the skylines of fables, where the dreams of men unfurl
This is our world, this is our home, this is our city's twirl

But when the night descends, and the stars begin to gleam
The city shows another face, in the moon's ethereal beam
The shadows dance with secrets, and the alleys whisper tales
Of the dreams that were forgotten, and the love that never sails

Yet still we move together, through the darkness and the light
Through the struggles and the triumphs, with every dawn so bright
For in these skylines of fables, we write our own story
In this city of dreams, we find our own true glory

So here's to the skylines, and the fables yet untold
To the dreams that will unfold, and the hearts strong and bold
Who will shape the future, with their courage and their might
In this city of wonders, in the glow of purest light.
