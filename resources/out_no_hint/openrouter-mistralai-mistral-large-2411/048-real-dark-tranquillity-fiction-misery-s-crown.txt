In the cold embrace of endless night
We're lost within this labyrinth
Of twisted thoughts and faded dreams
Where hope is just a memory

Within this world of make-believe
We lose ourselves in sweet deceit
The truth is gone, the lies remain
In this illusion we're insane

We're lost within this labyrinth
Of twisted thoughts and faded dreams
Where hope is just a memory

In the cold embrace of endless night
We're lost within this labyrinth
Of twisted thoughts and faded dreams
Where hope is just a memory

Within this world of make-believe
We lose ourselves in sweet deceit
The truth is gone, the lies remain
In this illusion we're insane

We're lost within this labyrinth
Of twisted thoughts and faded dreams
Where hope is just a memory

We're lost within this labyrinth
Of twisted thoughts and faded dreams
Where hope is just a memory

In the cold embrace of endless night
We're lost within this labyrinth
Of twisted thoughts and faded dreams
Where hope is just a memory
