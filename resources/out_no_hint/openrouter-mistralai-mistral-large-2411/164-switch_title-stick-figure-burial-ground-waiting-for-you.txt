I've been searching in the dark
For a light to shine
Feeling all the shadows close
But I'm doing fine

I've been waiting all this time
For a dream to come
Feeling all the weight of the world
But I'm not giving up

I've been walking down this road
For a thousand years
Feeling all the weight of the world
But I'm not shedding tears

I've been waiting for you
To come and take my hand
I've been waiting for you
To come and understand

That I've been walking down this road
For a thousand miles
Feeling all the weight of the world
But I've been living in denial

I've been waiting for you
To come and take my hand
I've been waiting for you
To come and understand

So here's to the dreams that we share
And here's to the love that we bear
Here's to the hope that we need
To carry on

I've been waiting for you
To come and take my hand
I've been waiting for you
To come and understand.
