Is this too heavy for you
Is this too much for you
I think you're getting all you asked for
Is this too real for you
Is this too hard for you
I think you're falling down the stairs again

So long
Goodbye

Is this too nasty for you
Is this too ugly for you
I think you're running out of places to hide
Is this too loud for you
Is this too sudden for you
I think you're losing all the things you love

So long
Goodbye

Is this too black for you
Is this too dark for you
I think you're slowly changing all the time
Is this too real for you
Is this too hard for you
I think you're falling down the stairs again

So long
Goodbye

Is this too black for you
Is this too dark for you
I think you're slowly changing all the time
Is this too real for you
Is this too hard for you
I think you're falling down the stairs again

So long
Goodbye

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
