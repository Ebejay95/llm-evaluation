I've got a fistful of nothing
A heart that's broke again
I've got a head full of questions
And a bottle for a friend

Maybe these memories
Will be the death of me
I've got a longing so lonely
That not even you can see

We took a joyride
Through the streets of shame
We laughed and cried
Through this stupid game

We took a joyride
Through the streets of shame
We laughed and cried
Through this stupid game

I've got a room full of silence
A life that's pointless too
I've got a mind full of pictures
And a needle full of you

Maybe these memories
Will be the death of me
I've got a longing so lonely
That not even you can see

We took a joyride
Through the streets of shame
We laughed and cried
Through this stupid game

We took a joyride
Through the streets of shame
We laughed and cried
Through this stupid game

I've got a heart full of sorrow
A mind full of decay
I've got a room full of mirrors
And a bottle for a friend

Maybe these memories
Will be the death of me
I've got a longing so lonely
That not even you can see

We took a joyride
Through the streets of shame
We laughed and cried
Through this stupid game

We took a joyride
Through the streets of shame
We laughed and cried
Through this stupid game.
