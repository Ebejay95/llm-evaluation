This is my handsome gift,
It's only skin,
A little piece of Christian,
For your sins,
I'll bash you against,
The rocks that I keep,
In my pocket,
Full of me,
I'll be your Satan,
In the kitten mask,
I'll be your baby,
In the Duracell,
I'll be your lamb,
And you can shear me,
I'll be your scapegoat,
You can share me,
I'll be your scapegoat,
You can share me.
