I see the world through different eyes
A stranger in my home
I feel the lines begin to blur
The sweet turns into cold

I see the darkness in the light
The silence in the noise
I feel the current pulling me
To fill this endless void

I know the danger's out there
I know the evil's real
I feel the poison in my heart
The pain that will not heal

I know the ghosts that haunt me
The shadows in the night
I feel the current pulling me
To lose myself in flight

I see the world through different eyes
A stranger in my home
I feel the lines begin to blur
The sweet turns into cold

I see the darkness in the light
The silence in the noise
I feel the current pulling me
To fill this endless void
