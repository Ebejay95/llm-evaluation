In the heart of the city, where the neon lights glow
Shadows dance silently, in a electric show
Patterns weave silently, in the darkness they sway
Underneath the black light, we chase the night away

Streets are paved with whispers, echoes of the past
Secrets hide in alleyways, in the silence they're cast
We're walking on a wire, between the light and dark
In this silent pattern, we leave our lonely mark

Chasing after ghosts, in the echoes of our minds
Looking for the answers, that we left behind
The city's heart is beating, in a rhythm cold and slow
In the electric shadows, where the silent patterns flow

Through the fog of memories, we're searching for a sign
Lost in the black echo, of this silent design
But when the dawn comes calling, and the shadows turn to gold
We'll find our way back home, where our silent story's told.
