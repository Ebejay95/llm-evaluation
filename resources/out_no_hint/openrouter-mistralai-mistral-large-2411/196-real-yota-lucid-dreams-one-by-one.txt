Walking in the cold light, I've been drifting through the days
Feeling like a ghost, in this town, in this haze
But when I close my eyes, I'm not scared, I'm not alone
In my lucid dreams, I'm coming home, one by one

I can see your face, feel your touch, hear your voice
In this secret place, where we meet, where we have no choice
But to be together, in this world that we've made
In my lucid dreams, I'm not afraid, one by one

We'll turn the night away, we'll turn the night away
We'll turn the night away, we'll turn the night away

So here's to the love, that we had, that we lost
To the dreams, that we have, at any cost
In my lucid dreams, I'm counting stars, one by one
In my lucid dreams, I'm coming home, one by one
