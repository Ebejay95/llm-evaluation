In the shadow of the mountains, in the valley below
Lived a boy with a dream, not so long ago
He dreamed of the sunshine, of the dawns early light
But the world cast a shadow, and it blocked out the light

He tried to break free, but the walls were too high
He called for salvation, but he heard his echo reply
He knew that he had to, find a way to be strong
To find himself a life, to find himself a song

He dreamed of the sunshine, of the dawns early light
But the world cast a shadow, and it blocked out the light
He knew that he had to, find a way to be strong
To find himself a life, to find himself a song

He knew that he had to, find a way to be strong
To find himself a life, to find himself a song

In the shadow of the mountains, in the valley below
Lived a boy with a dream, not so long ago
He dreamed of the sunshine, of the dawns early light
But the world cast a shadow, and it blocked out the light

He knew that he had to, find a way to be strong
To find himself a life, to find himself a song

He knew that he had to, find a way to be strong
To find himself a life, to find himself a song
