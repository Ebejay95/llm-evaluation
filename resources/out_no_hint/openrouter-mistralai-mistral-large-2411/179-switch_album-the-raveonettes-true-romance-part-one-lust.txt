In your heart, where the demons play
In your eyes, I've gone astray
I wanna be all over you
I wanna be your number one

I wanna do it all to you
I wanna be your number one
I wanna be all over you
I wanna be your number one

In your bed, where the shadows fall
In your dreams, I'm ten feet tall
I wanna be all over you
I wanna be your number one

I wanna do it all to you
I wanna be your number one
I wanna be all over you
I wanna be your number one

Lust, lust, lust, lust for love
Lust, lust, lust, lust for love.
