I am the wolf in the night
I am the shimmering light
I am the silence in the room
I am the tune that you croon

I am the howl in the crowd
I am the scream, I am loud
I am the struggle, I am the fight
I am the long-lost light

I am the wolf in the night
I am the shimmering light
I am the silence in the room
I am the tune that you croon

I am the howl in the crowd
I am the scream, I am loud
I am the struggle, I am the fight
I am the long-lost light

I am the wolf in the night
I am the shimmering light
I am the silence in the room
I am the tune that you croon

I am the howl in the crowd
I am the scream, I am loud
I am the struggle, I am the fight
I am the long-lost light

I am the wolf in the night
I am the shimmering light
I am the silence in the room
I am the tune that you croon

I am the howl in the crowd
I am the scream, I am loud
I am the struggle, I am the fight
I am the long-lost light

I am the wolf in the night
I am the shimmering light
I am the silence in the room
I am the tune that you croon

I am the howl in the crowd
I am the scream, I am loud
I am the struggle, I am the fight
I am the long-lost light

I am the wolf in the night
I am the shimmering light
I am the silence in the room
I am the tune that you croon

I am the howl in the crowd
I am the scream, I am loud
I am the struggle, I am the fight
I am the long-lost light
