In a town that never sleeps
Underneath the neon lights
There's a river that flows steady
Through the shadows of the night

Green river, green river
Carry me away
I don't need these city lights
Or the noise of the day

Through the concrete and the wire
Past the factories and mills
There's a path that's worn and familiar
And it's calling me still

Green river, green river
Take me back in time
To the days when life was simple
And my heart was so divine

Oh, the sun beats down upon my face
And the wind is in my hair
I can feel the world turn underneath me
And I don't have a care

Green river, green river
Wash these troubles from my mind
Let me find what I've been looking for
Leave these city lights behind

In the silence and the stillness
Underneath the starry sky
There's a truth that I've been searching for
And I know it's close by

Green river, green river
Show me what is real
In the hush of the morning
Let me know just how you feel

Oh, the days turn into weeks at a time
And the years pass by like days
But the river keeps on flowing
And it always finds its way

Green river, green river
Take me far away
To a place where I can start over
And begin a brand new day.
