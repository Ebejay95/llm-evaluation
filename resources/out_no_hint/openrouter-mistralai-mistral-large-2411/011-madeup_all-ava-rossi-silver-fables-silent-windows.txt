In the hollow of a tree, where the wild winds blow
There lived a little girl, small as a sparrow
Skin white as snow, hair black as a crow
In a dress of feathers, she danced to and fro

She spoke to the creatures, she sang with the breeze
Her heart beat like thunder, her soul roamed free as the seas
But the world came a-knocking, and the windows pane
It shattered her silence, and she was never the same

Oh, silver fables, and silent windows
Oh, the rain came down, and the dark winds blew

She stepped from her shelter, her eyes wide with fright
The storm it did howl, and the skies turned black as night
Her feathers fell 'round her, like tears from above
As she walked through the tempest, she lost the ones she loved

She wandered through forests, she crossed the great sea
She climbed the tall mountains, searching for the key
To the song that she sang, to the dance that she knew
To the heart that beat thunder, under skies cold and blue

Oh, silver fables, and silent windows
Oh, the rain came down, and the dark winds blew

In the hollow of a tree, where the wild winds blow
There lived a little girl, small as a sparrow
Skin white as snow, hair black as a crow
In a dress of feathers, she danced to and fro

But her song was forgotten, and her dance was too
And her heart beat so softly, and her soul turned blue
For the world came a-knocking, and the windows pane
It shattered her silence, and she was never the same

Oh, silver fables, and silent windows
Oh, the rain came down, and the dark winds blew.
