I'm drowning in a sea of doubt
Can I trust the ones who claim to care?
Their words are loud, but they're not clear
I'm hanging by a moment

I'm lost within the shadows cast
By the choices that I've made
I'm hoping that the worst has passed
I'm hanging by a moment

I'm holding on to what I know
But I'm starting to let go
I'm watching everything escape me
I'm hanging by a moment

The silence is a symphony
That's screaming out for me to hear
The echoes of my memories
Are fading, but they're still here

I'm holding on to what I know
But I'm starting to let go
I'm watching everything escape me
I'm hanging by a moment
