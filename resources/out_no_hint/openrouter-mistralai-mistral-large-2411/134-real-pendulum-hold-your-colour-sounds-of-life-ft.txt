In the silence I've been searching
For a sign that life's begun
And the coldness of this void
Is all I've ever known

I've been waiting for this moment
To arrive and show me more
But the echoes of my dreams
Are all that I adore

I've been trying to find the friction
To ignite my soul alight
But the words that I can't say
Are screaming in the night

I've been looking for a way
To escape this endless sea
But the sounds of life are fading
And taking all with me

I've been reaching for the answers
To the questions in my mind
But the echoes of my dreams
Are all that I can find

I've been hoping for a saviour
To release me from this hell
But the silence of this emptiness
Is all that I can tell

I've been waiting for this moment
To arrive and show me more
But the echoes of my dreams
Are all that I adore

I've been trying to find the friction
To ignite my soul alight
But the words that I can't say
Are screaming in the night

I've been looking for a way
To escape this endless sea
But the sounds of life are fading
And taking all with me
