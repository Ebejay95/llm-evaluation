In the heart of the city, under neon lights,
There's a place where the lonely go, in the midnight hours.
Echoes of crystal, dreams take flight,
Waves of stories, in the midnight rooms.

Silhouettes dancing, shadows on the wall,
Whispers of secrets, in the hallowed halls.
Underneath the mirror ball, we lose control,
In the midnight rooms, we surrender souls.

Strobe lights flashing, beat of the drum,
Heartbeats racing, as the night begins.
Ghosts of the past, in every corner hid,
In the midnight rooms, we come to rid.

Champagne glasses, raise them high,
Under the moon, and the city sky.
Toast to the lovers, and the dreams that died,
In the midnight rooms, where we confide.

So here's to the midnight rooms, and the tales they tell,
Of love and loss, and the dreams that fell.
In the heart of the city, under neon glow,
Midnight rooms club, where the lonely go.
