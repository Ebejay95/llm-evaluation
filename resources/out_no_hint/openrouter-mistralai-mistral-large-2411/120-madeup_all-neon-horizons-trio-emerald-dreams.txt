Drifting on a jade mist sea
Beneath the neon moon's glow
Emerald dreams cascade on me
In silent echoes they flow

Through the labyrinths of time
I wander far, I roam wide
In cities built on clouds so fine
I find my spirit purified

Stardust whispers paint the night
With tales of love and lore so old
In every heartbeat, in every sight
A universe within unfolds

So here's to dreams that dance and weave
To memories that never leave
