In a world that you create,
You can be whatever you want to be.
In your heart, in your soul,
You are the master of your own reality.

You can fly, you can dream,
You can break every boundary and every wall.
In this place, in this time,
You are the one who can answer the call.

But remember, my friend,
That every road has an end, has a beginning.
And the choices you make,
Will determine if your heart is spinning.

So take hold of the wheel,
And don't let your fears keep you from steering.
You're the hero today,
And your story is worth telling, worth hearing.

Time's arrow never stops,
It keeps moving towards the end of the line.
But the memories we make,
Will forever be yours, will forever be mine.

So live, love, and be free,
And don't let the past hold you back from your future.
In this world, in this life,
You are the writer, the painter, the producer.
