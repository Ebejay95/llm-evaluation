Lost in the city lights,
Feeling the urban blight,
Neon signs are shining bright,
In the cold and endless night.

We're chasing dreams like stars above,
Looking for a sense of love,
In every shadow, every glove,
Trying to rise above the shove.

Galaxy, galaxy, so far away,
In your stars, I want to stray,
Through the milky way, find a place to stay,
Where the pain and sorrow fade away.

Concrete jungle, steel and stone,
Feeling lost, so all alone,
In this crowded place I've outgrown,
Searching for a seed to sow.

Galaxy, galaxy, shining in the night,
Guide me with your softest light,
Through the darkness, through the endless fight,
To a place where dreams take flight.

Underneath the moon so blue,
I'm reaching out, I'm calling you,
In every whisper, in every hue,
I'm searching for a path that's true.

Galaxy, galaxy, echoing my song,
In your stars, I feel I belong,
Through the cosmos, through the endless throng,
With you, I know that I'm strong.

So here's to the dreams that we share,
To the hopes and the hearts laid bare,
In the galaxy, in the cool night air,
Together, we'll find our way there.
