In the heart of the night, I'm walking alone,
In the cold of the moon, shadows are thrown,
I'm chasing your ghost, through the streets we knew,
But they're empty and bare, life has withdrawn from this view.

I'm calling your name, but the wind is my only reply,
The echoes are fading, under the mourning sky,
I'm searching for you, in the pouring rain,
But we're lost in the echoes, lost in the echoes again.

The city's a grave, and the buildings stand tall,
As the memories of you, on every wall I crawl,
I'm screaming for you, but the darkness has taken your place,
The silence is killing me, the silence is killing your face.
