You will die, sooner or later
You will live, sooner or later
You will see, sooner or later
We'll be gone

You will cry, sooner or later
You will laugh, sooner or later
You will dance, sooner or later
We'll be gone

If you're left behind
In this world you'll find
There's nothing left to see
Except for misery

You will die, sooner or later
You will live, sooner or later
You will see, sooner or later
We'll be gone

You will cry, sooner or later
You will laugh, sooner or later
You will dance, sooner or later
We'll be gone

So say goodbye, sooner or later
Don't say goodbye, sooner or later
Just turn away, sooner or later
We'll be gone

Say goodbye, sooner or later
Don't say goodbye, sooner or later
Just turn away, sooner or later
We'll be gone
