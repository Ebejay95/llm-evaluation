In this cold world, I've found my home
In your eyes, I've found my hope
Through the darkness, through the rain
I'll be the one to heal your pain

We've been through hell, we've been through fire
Our love story's never gonna tire
In this silent storm, we'll find our way
Together we'll heal, come what may

So here's to us, to the love that's true
To the silent stories that we knew
With every sunrise, with every sunset
In this love, I'll never regret

In this cold world, you're my warm light
Through the darkest night, you're my bright
In this silent storm, we'll find our sound
Together we'll rise, together we'll be crowned.
