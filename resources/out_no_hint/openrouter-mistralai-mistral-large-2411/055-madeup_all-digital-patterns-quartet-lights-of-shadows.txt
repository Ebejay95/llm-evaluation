In the heart of the city, where the neon lights glow
Shadows dance and whisper, secrets only they know
Echoes of laughter, dreams lost in the night
Underneath the moonbeam, we search for the light

Streets paved with silence, canyons made of steel
In the echo of your footsteps, feelings we conceal
Ghosts of yesterday, memories we've outgrown
Wander through the alleyways, places we have known

Chasing after sunsets, in the cold and endless rain
Through the labyrinth of shadows, love is just a name
But in the heart of the city, where the lonely spirits roam
We'll find our way together, we'll turn the lights back on
