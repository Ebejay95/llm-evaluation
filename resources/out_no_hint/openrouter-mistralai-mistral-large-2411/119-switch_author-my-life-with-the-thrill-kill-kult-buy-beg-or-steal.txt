After the music starts playing, I'll be on my way
I'll be gone before you even hear me say
I got a date with a man who's gonna set me free
Got a pocket full of dreams and I ain't paying

Buy, beg or steal, get me something for nothing
Buy, beg or steal, I'll take anything I'm touching
Buy, beg or steal, I want something for free
Buy, beg or steal, I'll take anything I'm touching

I got a woman, she's a natural born thief
She'll take your heart and leave you crying in your sleep
I got a date with a man who's gonna set me free
Got a pocket full of dreams and I ain't paying

Buy, beg or steal, get me something for nothing
Buy, beg or steal, I'll take anything I'm touching
Buy, beg or steal, I want something for free
Buy, beg or steal, I'll take anything I'm touching

I got a woman, she's a natural born thief
She'll take your heart and leave you crying in your sleep
I got a date with a man who's gonna set me free
Got a pocket full of dreams and I ain't paying

Buy, beg or steal, get me something for nothing
Buy, beg or steal, I'll take anything I'm touching
Buy, beg or steal, I want something for free
Buy, beg or steal, I'll take anything I'm touching

Buy, beg or steal, get me something for nothing
Buy, beg or steal, I'll take anything I'm touching
Buy, beg or steal, I want something for free
Buy, beg or steal, I'll take anything I'm touching
