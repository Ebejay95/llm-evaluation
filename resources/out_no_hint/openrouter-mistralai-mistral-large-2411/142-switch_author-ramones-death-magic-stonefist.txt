I'm walking down a lonely street
I don't know where I'm going
I'm looking for a stranger
I don't know who he is

Death magic, death magic
Coming down on me
Death magic, death magic
I don't want it to be

I'm running through the graveyard
I don't know what I'm running for
I'm hiding in the shadows
I don't know what I'm hiding for

Death magic, death magic
Coming down on me
Death magic, death magic
I don't want it to be

Stonefist, stonefist
You're just a man
Stonefist, stonefist
I don't know what you are

I'm fighting in the dark now
I don't know what I'm fighting for
I'm screaming out your name now
I don't know what I'm screaming for

Death magic, death magic
Coming down on me
Death magic, death magic
I don't want it to be

Stonefist, stonefist
You're just a man
Stonefist, stonefist
I don't know what you are

Death magic, death magic
Coming down on me
Death magic, death magic
I don't want it to be
