In the beginning
There was nothing at all
Then a light came shining
And then there was a wall
And the wall became a host
To the life that came from
The everglow

And the everglow
Became the colours
And the colours
Became the sound
And the sound became
The all and everything
And everything
And everything
And everything

And the all and everything
Became a little peace
And the everglow
Became a part
Of the all and everything
And the all and everything
Became a little
Became a little
Became a little peace

And the everglow
Became a part
Of the all and everything
And the all and everything
Became a little
Became a little
Became a little peace

And the everglow
Became a part
Of the all and everything
And the all and everything
Became a little
Became a little
Became a little peace
