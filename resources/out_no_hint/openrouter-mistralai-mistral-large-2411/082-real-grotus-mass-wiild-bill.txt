Oh, I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay
I sleep all night and I work all day

I cut down trees, I eat my lunch
I cut down trees, I eat my lunch
I cut down trees, I eat my lunch
On Wednesdays I go shoppin'
And have buttered scones for tea

I cut down trees, I eat my lunch
I cut down trees, I skip and jump
I cut down trees, I like to press wild flowers
I put on women's clothing
And hang around in bars

I cut down trees, I wear high heels
Suspendies and a bra
I wish I'd been a girlie
Just like my dear mama

He cut down trees, he eats his lunch
He's a lumberjack and he's okay
He sleeps all night and he works all day

He cuts down trees, he eats his lunch
He's a lumberjack and he's okay
Sleeps all night and he works all day
