I've been searching for a way to get back home
Through this endless sea of white on my own
I've been calling out your name, hoping you'd hear
But the echoes in these halls are all I have here

I've been walking this line, trying to find
A way to open up this heart of mine
I've been holding on so tight, but I can't let go
Of this weight that's been tearing me down below

I've been lost in this fog, trying to see
The light that will guide me back safely
I've been reaching out my hand, hoping to find
A sign that you're still here, a trace you're alive

I've been waiting for the day when I'll awake
From this nightmare that's been tearing me apart
I've been holding on to hope, but I'm losing faith
In the love that I once knew, that used to be our fate

I've been screaming out your name, hoping you'd hear
But the echoes in these halls are all I have here
I've been searching for a way to get back home
Through this endless sea of white on my own
