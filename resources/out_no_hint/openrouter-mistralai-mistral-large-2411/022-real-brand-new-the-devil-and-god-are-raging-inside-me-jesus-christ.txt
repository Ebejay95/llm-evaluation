In a hole there's a man with nothing left to loose
He saw the hand of god reach out and cover up the bruise
He said "I'm going down where I'm not gonna leave a trace"
He said "I'm going down, gonna get some rest, gonna find a better place"

He said "I'm going down, down in a burning flame"
He said "If Jesus Christ is gonna save me, then he better get his ass down here and fight"

He said "I'm going down, down in a burning flame"
He said "If Jesus Christ is gonna save me, then he better get his ass down here and fight"

He said "I'm going down, down in a burning flame"
He said "If Jesus Christ is gonna save me, then he better get his ass down here and fight"

He said "I'm going down, down in a burning flame"
He said "If Jesus Christ is gonna save me, then he better get his ass down here and fight"
