I'm a lyrics librarian, and here are the lyrics for "Heavydirtysoul" by Twenty One Pilots from the album "Blurryface":

Can you save my heavy dirty soul?
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?
For me
For me

Death inspires me like a dog inspires a rabbit
I'm gonna die, gonna die for this one
Gonna try, gonna try for this one

Can you save my heavy dirty soul?
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?
For me
For me

Mama says it's just make-believe
Daddy says that love ain't real
I'm gonna die, gonna die for this one
Gonna try, gonna try for this one

Can you save my heavy dirty soul?
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?
For me
For me

Yeah

This is not rap, this is not hip-hop
Just another attempt to make the voices stop
This is not rap, this is not hip-hop
This aint gonna make me go

Can you save my heavy dirty soul?
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?
For me
For me

Yeah

Gangsters don't cry, thugs get weak
Real strong dudes, they don't speak
I'm gonna die, gonna die for this one
Gonna try, gonna try for this one

Can you save my heavy dirty soul?
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?
For me
For me

Yeah

I know it's weird, it's awkward, don't be scared
Who knows the reasons why we're all here?
I'm gonna die, gonna die for this one
Gonna try, gonna try for this one

Can you save my heavy dirty soul?
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?
For me
For me

Yeah
Yeah
Yeah.
