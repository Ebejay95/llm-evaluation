I've been waiting here for days
In the graveyard where we played
As children we would chase
Through the tombstones we would race

Now I sit alone

On this hill where we would lay
And watch the setting sun display
Its colors bright and gold
In your arms I used to hold

Your memory like a ghost
Haunting me from coast to coast
I still see your smiling face
In every lonely place

I've been waiting here for nights
Underneath the cold moonlights
Where you promised we would wed
In the silence of the dead

Now I sit alone

In the cold and in the dark
With just an old headstone to mark
The spot where you used to be
Where you whispered you loved me

Your memory like a ghost
Haunting me from coast to coast
I still see your smiling face
In every lonely place

I've been waiting here for years
Through the sorrow and the tears
And the snow and the rain
But you promised you'd come back again

Now I sit alone

By the grave that bears your name
And every day it's just the same
I come here and wait for you
Like I promised I would do

Your memory like a ghost
Haunting me from coast to coast
I still see your smiling face
In every lonely place

I've been waiting here forever
Through the storms of harsh weather
And the sun and the wind
But you promised you'd come back again

Now I sit alone

In the graveyard where we played
As children we would chase
Through the tombstones we would race

Your memory like a ghost
Haunting me from coast to coast
I still see your smiling face
In every lonely place

I've been waiting here forever
In the graveyard where we played.
