In the realm where the wild ones be,
Underneath the old oak tree,
You and I in a blur of green,
On a swing, in a dream unseen.

I carved our names, aurora scenes,
In the bark where the lightning leaned,
With every sunset, we'd meet again,
Underneath the old oak tree's reign.

Yeht mae, eam they, you'd softly say,
In a language only we obey,
Aurora scenes, our hearts entwined,
In the world of dreams combined.

But now you're gone, the tree stands bare,
Our names carved soft, a lonely pair,
Yeht mae, eam they, I whisper low,
In the realm where the wild ones go.
