In the dark of the moon I invoke you
Calling Hecate Herodias Lilith Sekhmet
To raise up the dead, to fly through the night
To the sabbat, to dance in the light

I call up the devil in the name of the lord
I call up the devil, the lord of the world
I call up the devil, the lord of this world

I call forth the powers of darkness
To shake off the chains of the lord
To shake off the chains of Jehovah

I call forth the powers of darkness
To shake off the chains of the lord
To shake off the chains of Jehovah

Lucifer, Lucifer, rise
Lucifer, Lucifer, rise
Lucifer, Lucifer, rise
