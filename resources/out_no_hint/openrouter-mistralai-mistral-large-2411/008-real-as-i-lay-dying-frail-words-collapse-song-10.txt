I can't take these eyes, they see right through me
Awake to this nightmare, it's tearing me down
Beneath the surface, I know I'm all the same
I've become what I've always hated

Another day has come and gone, and I am still the same
The light I had is faded now, I've lost my way again

I've tried to move away from this place that's cold
But I keep falling down, I keep losing control

I've become what I've always hated

I've tried to move away from this place that's cold
But I keep falling down, I keep losing control

I've become what I've always hated

I've tried to move away from this place that's cold
But I keep falling down, I keep losing control

I've become what I've always hated

I've tried to move away from this place that's cold
But I keep falling down, I keep losing control

I've become what I've always hated

I've become what I've always hated
