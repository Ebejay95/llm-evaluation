In the heart of the city, under neon lights
There's a club that's not like the others at night
Silver lights and the mirrored ball
Walls of shadows where the lost ones crawl

Echoes of laughter, echoes of song
In the haze of the evening, we'll find where we belong
Through the wandering rooms, we'll drift and we'll dream
In the silence, we'll hear what we've never seen

Signals in the dark, signals in the night
Guiding us forward, into the pure light
Fourteen signals, clear and bright
Through the shadows, into the pure light

So here's to the losers, here's to the lost
To those who pay the price, and those who pay the cost
In the silver lights club, under the moon's soft glow
We'll find our way home, where the wandering rivers flow.
