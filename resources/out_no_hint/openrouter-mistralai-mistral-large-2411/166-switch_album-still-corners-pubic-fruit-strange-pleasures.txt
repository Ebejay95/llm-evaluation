I was driving out on the highway
Found myself in a strange place
I saw things that I'd never seen before
Felt a feeling I didn't know

I was lost in the city
I was lost in the rain
I was lost in the fire
I was lost in a game

I was high on the highway
I was lost in the sky
I was high on the strange pleasures
I was high on the strange pleasures

I was lost in the city
I was lost in the rain
I was lost in the fire
I was lost in a game

I was high on the highway
I was lost in the sky
I was high on the strange pleasures
I was high on the strange pleasures

I was high on the strange pleasures
I was high on the strange pleasures
