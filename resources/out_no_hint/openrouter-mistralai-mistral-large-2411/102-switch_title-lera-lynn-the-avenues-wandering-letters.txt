I've been walking these avenues
In the black of the night
Through the echoing footsteps
And the shadows they write

I've been chasing your ghost
In the town where we met
Through the memories that linger
And the dreams that we've left

I've been reading your letters
The ones that you sent
They're just wandering words
On a page that's been bent

I've been searching for answers
In the lines of your hand
But the ink's running dry now
And I'm losing my plan

I've been calling your name
In the dark of the night
But the echoes keep fading
And the dawn's taking flight

I've been walking these avenues
Where the shadows still fall
But your ghost has left nothing
And the letters say it all.
