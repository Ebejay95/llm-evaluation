I'm just a fool, sitting on this old bar stool,
Watching them cocktails go past,
Wasting another night, under the neon light,
Forgotten, in my glass,

I'm waiting for the happy hour,
When the lights are low and the drinks are half price,
I'm waiting for the happy hour,
Got no place to go, got no one to please,

I'm just a face, in this lonely place,
Drowning my sorrows again,
I'm just a clown, painting this town,
In a circus, that never ends,

I'm waiting for the happy hour,
When the jukebox plays all my favorite songs,
I'm waiting for the happy hour,
I don't care if it takes all night long,

I'm gonna bop 'til I drop,
Shake it all out on the floor,
I'm gonna bop 'til I drop,
'Cause I just can't take it no more.
