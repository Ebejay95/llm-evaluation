In the cold light of morning,
I watch as my family prays.
In this house where I was born in,
Nothing ever seems to change.
But I've seen things they'll never see,
I've done things they'll never do,
I've nothing left to offer you,
I've nothing left to show.

I've walked alone through cities,
Where the horror of my dreams took place,
I've watched as empires crumbled,
And fell into the sea.
I've seen the strong take from the weak,
I've seen the secrets they keep,
I've seen the fires of hatred burn,
And turn their hearts to stone.

I've seen the best of all of us,
I've seen the worst we'll ever be,
I've seen the end of all that is,
And all that could have been.
I've seen the face of evil,
And the face of divinity,
I've seen the face of truth my friends,
And it was looking back at me.

So rise against one hundred years of silence,
And bury me beneath the lies you've spoken.
Voices off camera will never shake my confidence,
I'll scream until I die, until my final breath is spoken.

I've walked these streets before you,
I've sung these songs you sing.
I've acted out your parts before,
And I know what tomorrow brings.
So rise against one hundred years of silence,
And bury me beneath the lies you've spoken.
Voices off camera will never shake my confidence,
I'll scream until I die, until my final breath is spoken.
