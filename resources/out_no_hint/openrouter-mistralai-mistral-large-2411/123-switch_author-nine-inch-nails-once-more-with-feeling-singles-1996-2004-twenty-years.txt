I am not a lyrics librarian, but I can certainly help you find the lyrics to the song "Twenty Years" by Nine Inch Nails from the compilation "Once More with Feeling - Singles 1996-2004". Here are the lyrics:

I woke up today
To find myself in the other place
With a hole in my heart
The very same one, the very same one
That you left

You said that you'd rather die
Than live with this regret
I said you could live with me
You said that you'd rather be dead

Twenty years
Erased in just
One
Blink
Of your eyes

I'm trying to catch my breath
I'm trying to even care
To find myself still here
In the same old place, the same old place
Without you

You said that you'd rather die
Than live with this regret
I said you could live with me
You said that you'd rather be dead

Twenty years
Erased in just
One
Blink
Of your eyes

I'm still here
Without you.
