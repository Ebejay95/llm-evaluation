I'm riding down a lonesome highway, just lookin' for a place to stay,
A friendly room to end the day, to find a bed and rest my head.

I saw the sign "Hoagascht" and "Nachteule" on the door,
I never saw a friendly place before that looked so good and warm.

I walked inside and took a table in the corner by the wall,
I ordered wine and watched the people, who were having such a ball.

They had an old piano, for a nickel it would play,
An old-time waltz or polka song, a melody so gay.

The people laughed and danced and sang, their laughter filled the air,
They really had a lot of fun, without a single care.

I asked the waitress for a dance, she said she didn't mind,
We waltzed around the old dance floor, to music old and fine.

I danced with her till closin' time, then walked her to her home,
She invited me to come inside, but I said I must roam.

I thanked her for the evening, the finest I'd spent in years,
I'll always think of "Hoagascht" and "Nachteule" with a cheer.

So here's to all the friendly places, where you can dance and dine,
May they have customers aplenty, may their businesses always shine.
