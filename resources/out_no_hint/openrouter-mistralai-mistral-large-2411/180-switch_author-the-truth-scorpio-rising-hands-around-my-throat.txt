I'm just a man, I'm just a man
What you see is what you get
I'm just a man, I'm just a man
But you're asking for more than that

You want me strong, you want me weak
You want me bold, you want me meek
You want me tough, you want me tame
Nothing's enough, nothing's the same

I'm just a man, I'm just a man
What you see is what you get
I'm just a man, I'm just a man
But you're asking for more than that

You want me here, you want me there
You want me gone, you want me rare
You want me to, you want me to not
Nothing's a lie, nothing's a thought

I'm just a man, I'm just a man
What you see is what you get
I'm just a man, I'm just a man
But you're asking for more than that

You want me to, you want me to stop
Nothing's right, nothing's wrong
You want me to, you want me to talk
Nothing's bad, nothing's good, nothing's enough

I'm just a man, I'm just a man
What you see is what you get
I'm just a man, I'm just a man
But you're asking for more than that

I'm just a man, I'm just a man
What you see is what you get
I'm just a man, I'm just a man
And you'll take me for what I am

I'm just a man, I'm just a man
What you see is what you get
I'm just a man, I'm just a man
And you'll take me for what I am

I'm just a man, I'm just a man
What you see is what you get
I'm just a man, I'm just a man
And you'll take me for what I am

I'm just a man, I'm just a man
What you see is what you get
I'm just a man, I'm just a man
And you'll take me for what I am

I'm just a man, I'm just a man
What you see is what you get
I'm just a man, I'm just a man
And you'll take me for what I am

I'm just a man, I'm just a man
What you see is what you get
I'm just a man, I'm just a man
And you'll take me for what I am

I'm just a man, I'm just a man
What you see is what you get
I'm just a man, I'm just a man
And you'll take me for what I am

I'm just a man, I'm just a man
What you see is what you get
I'm just a man, I'm just a man
And you'll take me for what I am

I'm just a man, I'm just a man
What you see is what you get
I'm just a man, I'm just a man
And you'll take me for what I am

I'm just a man, I'm just a man
What you see is what you get
I'm just a man, I'm just a man
And you'll take me for what I am

I'm just a man, I'm just a man
What you see is what you get
I'm just a man, I'm just a man
And you'll take me for what I am

I'm just a man, I'm just a man
What you see is what you get
I'm just a man, I'm just a man
And you'll take me for what I am

I'm just a man, I'm just a man
What you see is what you get
I'm just a man, I'm just a man
And you'll take me for what I am

I'm just a man, I'm just a man
What you see is what you get
I'm just a man, I'm just a man
And you'll take me for what I am

I'm just a man, I'm just a man
What you see is what you get
I'm just a man
