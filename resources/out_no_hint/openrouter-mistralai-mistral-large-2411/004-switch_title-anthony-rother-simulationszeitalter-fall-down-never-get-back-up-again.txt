In the simulationszeitalter
We are living in a world so strange
Where the lines between reality and fiction blur
And nothing ever seems to change

Fall down, never get back up again
Lost in the echoes of the digital rain
In the shadows of the machines that we've made
We're losing all the games that we've played

In the simulationszeitalter
We're dancing with the codes and routines
Where the smiles on the faces are just pixels on screens
And all that's left are shattered dreams

Fall down, never get back up again
Drowning in the silence of the circuit's hum
In the cold embrace of the data's flow
We're drifting further from the lives we know

In the simulationszeitalter
We're chasing ghosts in virtual space
Where the touch of a hand is a digital trace
And every moment leaves no place

Fall down, never get back up again
Caught in the loop of a programmed fate
In the endless night of the neon glow
We're losing all the love that we used to know.
