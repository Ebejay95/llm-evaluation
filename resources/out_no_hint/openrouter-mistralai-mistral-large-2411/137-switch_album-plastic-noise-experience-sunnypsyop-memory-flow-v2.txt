In the morning I wake up, see the sun
All the memories, all the way we've come
I can't believe it, I can't see the sense
All the nonsense, the pretense

I remember you, I remember me
I remember us, the way we used to be
I remember them, our friends, our foes
All the memories, all the highs and lows

In the evening I sit down, see the moon
All the memories, all the faded tune
I can't believe it, I can't see the sense
All the nonsense, the pretense

I remember you, I remember me
I remember us, the way we used to be
I remember them, our friends, our foes
All the memories in the memory flow.
