I'm a traveler in time, a wanderer in space
Chasing echoes of a forgotten grace
Through the skylines of fables, where the old tales reside
I'm searching for a truth that the ages hide

The moon is my compass, the stars are my guide
On this lonely journey, with nowhere to hide
Whispers of heroes, in the rustling leaves
Stories of giants, and mischievous thieves

Each city a chapter, each street a new line
In this grand, endless story, that's yours and that's mine
The sun paints the morning in hues of old gold
A new day is dawning, a new tale to be told

Through the skylines of fables, I'll continue to roam
Until I find the place that I can call home
A place built of legends, of courage and might
Bathed in the glow of an eternal light
