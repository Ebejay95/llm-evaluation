Silent windows, watching the rain fall down
Empty hallways in this lonely town
A photograph, a faded memory
Of a love that used to be

And the silence screams your name
In this cold and empty frame
Just a ghost of yesterday's flame
Playing a heartbreaking game

Streetlights paint a silver, hazy glow
On the paths where we used to go
Every corner holds a piece of you
In this world of gray and blue

And the silence screams your name
In this cold and empty frame
Just a ghost of yesterday's flame
Playing a heartbreaking game

I trace the glass, a cold and fragile pane
Hoping to feel you, to ease the pain
But all that's left is this hollow space
Without a single trace

And the silence screams your name
In this cold and empty frame
Just a ghost of yesterday's flame
Playing a heartbreaking game
