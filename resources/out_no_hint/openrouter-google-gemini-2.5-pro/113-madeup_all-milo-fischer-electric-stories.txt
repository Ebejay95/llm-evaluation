I remember when we were young
We'd run through fields under the sun
Chasing fireflies in the dusk
A world of wonder, built on trust

We'd climb the highest, creaking tree
Just to feel a little more free
Whispering secrets to the breeze
Rustling through the autumn leaves

Telling electric stories
In the pale moonlight
Painting futures, full of glories
Burning ever so bright
Just a couple of kids with starlit eyes
Underneath the endless skies

Years went by, the seasons turned
Lessons learned and bridges burned
The city's hum, a different sound
From the quiet of our hometown ground

We found new paths, we walked alone
On streets of steel and cold, hard stone
But in the quiet of the night
I'd search for that familiar light
