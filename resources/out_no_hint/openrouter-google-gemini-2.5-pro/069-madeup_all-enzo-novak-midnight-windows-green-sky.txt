Green sky, a silent warning
Clouds are shifting, day is dawning
On a world I used to know
Now a place I have to go

The air is thick with whispered fears
Counting moments, counting years
Since the color turned so strange
A fundamental, final change

And I walk beneath the emerald haze
Lost inside these timeless days
Searching for a patch of blue
Searching for a sign of you

The river runs a murky jade
A memory of a sunlit glade
Fades into this verdant light
Another day, another night

And I walk beneath the emerald haze
Lost inside these timeless days
Searching for a patch of blue
Searching for a sign of you
