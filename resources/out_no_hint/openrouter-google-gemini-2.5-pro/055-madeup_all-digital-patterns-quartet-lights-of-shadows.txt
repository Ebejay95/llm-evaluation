In the fading light, where the day meets night
A silent ballet, a beautiful sight
Dancing figures, in shades of gray
Chasing the darkness, keeping it at bay

Lights of shadows, a gentle embrace
Painting pictures, time cannot erase
Whispers of stories, in the cool night air
A fleeting moment, beyond compare

Through the window pane, a world unfolds
Mysteries written, in tales untold
A quiet symphony, soft and low
Where the lights of shadows gently flow

Lights of shadows, a gentle embrace
Painting pictures, time cannot erase

As the moon ascends, and the stars ignite
The shadows lengthen, in the pale moonlight
A final curtain, a graceful bow
In the heart of the quiet, here and now
