I'm walking on a black line
It's a thin and fragile thread
Between the world I'm leaving
And the one that lies ahead

The sky is painted crimson
A scene of fading light
Reflecting all the battles
I've fought throughout the night

Oh, the black line, the black line
Divides the living from the dead
A whisper in the silence
A voice inside my head

The fables that they told me
Are fading from my view
The heroes and the villains
I can't tell which is which, or who is who

I see the crimson scenes now
In every setting sun
A reminder of the choices
And the race that must be run

Oh, the black line, the black line
Divides the living from the dead
A whisper in the silence
A voice inside my head

Step by step, I'm moving
Don't know where it will lead
Just following this black line
Planting a hopeful seed

Maybe on the other side
The fables will be true
Maybe this crimson canvas
Will turn a shade of blue

Oh, the black line, the black line
Divides the living from the dead
A whisper in the silence
A voice inside my head
