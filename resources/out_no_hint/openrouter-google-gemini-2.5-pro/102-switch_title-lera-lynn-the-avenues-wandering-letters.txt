I'm walking down the avenues again
It's a beautiful day to be losing a friend
The sun is out, the sky is blue
There's a hole in my heart in the shape of you

I'm walking down the avenues again
It's a beautiful day to be losing a friend
The birds are singing a sorrowful tune
There's a hole in my heart in the shape of you

And I'm trying to find a way to get through
This beautiful day without you

I'm walking down the avenues again
It's a beautiful day to be losing a friend
The city's alive, the streets are a-buzz
There's a hole in my heart in the shape of you

And I'm trying to find a way to get through
This beautiful day without you

I'm walking down the avenues again
It's a beautiful day to be losing a friend
The sun is out, the sky is blue
There's a hole in my heart in the shape of you
