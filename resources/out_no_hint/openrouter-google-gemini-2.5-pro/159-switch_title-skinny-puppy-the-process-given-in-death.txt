Given in death
A final breath
The process unfolds
A story told
In whispers of the past
A shadow cast

The machine breathes life
A sterile knife
Cuts away the soul
To make it whole
In a vision of control
Taking its toll

Given in death
No time is left
The system's embrace
A cold, empty space
Where memories fade
A price is paid

The process complete
A bitter sweet
Release from the pain
A cleansing rain
Washes away the stain
Nothing remains
