I will not be broken
I will not be moved
I will not be shaken
I am not a fool

This is who we are
We will never fall
We are the one
We are the one
This is who we are
We will never fall
We are the one
We are the one

I will not be silenced
I will not be tamed
I will not be broken
I am not ashamed

This is who we are
We will never fall
We are the one
We are the one
This is who we are
We will never fall
We are the one
We are the one

We are the fallen
We are the broken
We are the chosen
We are the one
We are the fallen
We are the broken
We are the chosen
We are the one

This is who we are
We will never fall
We are the one
We are the one
This is who we are
We will never fall
We are the one
We are the one

We will not be broken
We will not be moved
We will not be shaken
We are not the fools
