Lights of motors, green sky
I'm looking for a place to hide
A place where I can be alone
And watch the world go by

The city is a jungle
And I'm just a small animal
Trying to survive
In this concrete jungle

I'm looking for a way out
A way to escape this madness
But I'm trapped in this city
And I can't find a way out

The lights of the motors are blinding me
And the green sky is suffocating me
I'm lost in this city
And I don't know where to go
