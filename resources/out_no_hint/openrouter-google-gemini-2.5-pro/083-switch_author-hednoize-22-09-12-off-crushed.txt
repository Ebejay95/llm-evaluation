Crushed, I'm crushed
I'm crushed by the weight of your words
I'm crushed by the things that you do
I'm crushed by the weight of your world
I'm crushed by the things that you say

I'm crushed by the weight of your words
I'm crushed by the things that you do
I'm crushed by the weight of your world
I'm crushed by the things that you say

I'm crushed by the weight of your words
I'm crushed by the things that you do
I'm crushed by the weight of your world
I'm crushed by the things that you say

I'm crushed
Crushed
Crushed
Crushed
