A long time ago, we were more than friends
I was a boy, you were a girl
I held your hand, you held my hand
And we ran, we ran, we ran so far away
But we were just kids, we didn't know
We were just kids, we had to go our separate ways

But now I'm back, and you're still here
And I'm so glad, I'm so glad you're here
'Cause I've missed you, I've missed you so much
And I just wanna hold you, I just wanna touch you
And I just wanna say

Goodbye, my friend, it's not the end
It's just the beginning of a new chapter
Goodbye, my love, it's not the end
It's just the beginning of a new adventure

We'll meet again, I know we will
We'll meet again, somewhere, somehow
But until then, I'll keep you in my heart
I'll keep you in my thoughts, I'll keep you in my prayers

Goodbye, my friend, it's not the end
It's just the beginning of a new chapter
Goodbye, my love, it's not the end
It's just the beginning of a new adventure

So don't you cry, don't you shed a tear
'Cause I'll be back, I'll be back for you, my dear
And we'll be together, we
