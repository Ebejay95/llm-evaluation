Cold is the water
It freezes your already cold mind
Already cold, cold mind
And death is the hour
It leaves you to fall far behind
Fall far behind

Sooner or later you're gonna be mine
Sooner or later you're gonna be fine
Sooner or later you're gonna be mine
Sooner or later you're gonna be fine

Lost is the battle
To win it you've gotta be blind
Gotta be blind, be blind
And doubt is a cancer
It's sleeping in the back of your mind
Back of your mind

Sooner or later you're gonna be mine
Sooner or later you're gonna be fine
Sooner or later you're gonna be mine
Sooner or later you're gonna be fine

I will wait forever
I will wait forever
I will wait forever
I will wait forever

Sooner or later you're gonna be mine
Sooner or later you're gonna be fine
Sooner or later you're gonna be mine
Sooner or later you're gonna be fine
Sooner or later you're gonna be mine
Sooner or later you're gonna be fine
Sooner or later you're gonna be mine
Sooner or later you're gonna be fine
