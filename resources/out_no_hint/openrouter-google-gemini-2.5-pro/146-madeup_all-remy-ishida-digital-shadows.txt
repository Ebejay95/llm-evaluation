In the neon glow, where the data streams,
We're living lives in digital dreams.
A silhouette flickers on a pixel screen,
A ghost in the code, a virtual scene.

Oh, digital shadows, dancing in the light,
Lost in the echo of the endless night.
We're chasing phantoms, holding nothing tight,
Just a fleeting image, a beautiful sight.

Your profile picture, a curated smile,
Hiding the truth for a little while.
We type our feelings, file by file,
Across the distance, mile after mile.

Oh, digital shadows, dancing in the light,
