I feel the sun on my skin
A warm and gentle touch
It brings back memories
Of a time I miss so much

The days were long and bright
We laughed and played all day
We thought it would last forever
But time just slipped away

Now I'm standing here alone
With just a memory
Of a love that used to be
A love that set me free

I close my eyes and I can see
Your face smiling back at me
I can hear your voice so clear
Whispering in my ear

The memories flow like a river
Washing over me
They bring me joy and sorrow
For a love that can never be

But I'll hold on to these memories
They're all I have left of you
And in my heart you'll always be
My one and only true love
