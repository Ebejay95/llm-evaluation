I see the signals of signals
A whisper in the static hum
A flicker in the dying flame
Before the storm has come

You write in golden letters
Across a canvas of the night
A language only we can read
Bathed in the pale moonlight

And every star's a punctuation
Every shadow is a word
The silent story of our love
The sweetest sound I've ever heard

The wind carries your secrets
Through the branches of the trees
A coded message on the breeze
That puts my restless heart at ease

You write in golden letters
Across a canvas of the night
A language only we can read
Bathed in the pale moonlight

A constellation of our moments
A map to where our futures lie
Drawn in the ink of passing time
Beneath an endless, watching sky

I see the signals of signals
The pattern in the falling rain
A promise whispered, soft and low
To find my way to you again
