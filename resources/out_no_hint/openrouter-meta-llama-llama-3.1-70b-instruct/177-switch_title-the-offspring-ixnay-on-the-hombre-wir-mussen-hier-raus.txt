I couldn't find any song by The Offspring with the title "Ixnay On The Hombre" that contains the lyrics "Wir müssen hier raus". However, I found that "Ixnay on the Hombre" is actually a song by The Offspring, but it's in English. If you want, I can provide you with those lyrics.

But I think I know what's going on here... "Wir müssen hier raus" is German for "We have to get out of here". And I think I have the song you're looking for...

"We have to get out of here, before we get caught
We have to get out of here, before we get caught"
