I couldn't find any information on a song by Marty Robbins with the title "Hoagascht, Nachteule". However, I found a song by Marty Robbins with the title "El Paso" that has a section with the lyrics:

"Out in the West Texas town of El Paso
I fell in love with a Mexican girl
Nighttime would find me in Rosa's cantina
Music would play and Felina would whirl"

But I also found a song with the title "El Paso" that has a section with the lyrics:

"Early one morning, the sheriff came to town
With a warrant for the one they called Big Jim
He was a bad man, but I loved him so
And I couldn't let him go"

And another section with the lyrics:

"Out in the West Texas town of El Paso
I fell in love with a Mexican girl
Nighttime would find me in Rosa's cantina
Music would play and Felina would whirl

Black is the color of the night
And the moon is shinin' bright
And I'm a-saddlein' up and I'm ridin' away
From the West Texas town of El Paso"

But I couldn't find any lyrics with the words "Hoagascht" or "Nachteule".
