"I've been searching for a way to break the mold
A way to shake the feeling that I've grown old
I've been trying to find my place in the world
But it's hard when you're stuck in a cycle that's unfurled

I've been chasing the highs and the lows
Trying to find a balance that nobody knows
I've been running from the ghosts that I've made
But they're always one step ahead, it's a never-ending chase

I'm restless, I'm searching for a way to be free
From the chains that bind me, from the weights that I carry
I'm trying to find my voice, my own identity
But it's hard when you're lost in the noise, in the chaos of humanity

Let go, let go, let go of the fear
Let go, let go, let go of the doubt and the tears
Let go, let go, let go of the pain
Let go, let go, let go and start again"
