I'm lost in the moment, I'm lost in the haze
Of the city lights, of the city ways
I'm chasing the highs, I'm chasing the lows
I'm searching for something, that nobody knows

I'm a ghost in the night, I'm a shadow on the wall
I'm a whisper in the wind, I'm a voice that's about to fall
I'm a stranger in the crowd, I'm a face in the sea
I'm a soul that's searching, for a place to be

I'm a dreamer, I'm a believer
I'm a heart that's beating, I'm a soul that's on fire
I'm a spirit that's soaring, I'm a mind that's exploring
I'm a life that's unfolding, like a story that's being told

I'm a moment in time, I'm a flash in the pan
I'm a fleeting thought, I'm a memory that's lost in the plan
I'm a fragment of a dream, I'm a piece of a puzzle
I'm a part of something, that's bigger than I am
