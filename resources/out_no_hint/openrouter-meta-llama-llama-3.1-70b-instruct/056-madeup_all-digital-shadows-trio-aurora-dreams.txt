"In the silence, I hear your voice
Whispers in the dark, a haunting choice
To follow the echoes, to chase the night
Into the shadows, where love takes flight

In the stillness, I feel your touch
A gentle breeze, that whispers so much
Of secrets kept, and mysteries untold
In the darkness, where our hearts unfold

Aurora dreams, they call to me
A siren's song, of ecstasy
In the silence, I am free
To follow the shadows, where you and I can be"
