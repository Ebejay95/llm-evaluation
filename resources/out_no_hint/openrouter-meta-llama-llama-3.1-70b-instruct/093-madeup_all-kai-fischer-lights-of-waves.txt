"In the lights of waves, I see your face
A fleeting glimpse, a wistful pace
The ocean's roar, a soothing sound
As I stand here, on this sandy ground

In the lights of waves, I feel your touch
A gentle breeze, a loving clutch
The stars above, a twinkling sea
Reflecting the dreams, that you and I used to be

In the lights of waves, I hear your voice
A whispered promise, a heartfelt choice
To follow the tide, to ride the night
And find our way, to a love so bright

In the lights of waves, I see our past
A bittersweet memory, that will forever last
The laughter and tears, the joy and the pain
A love so strong, that will forever remain"
