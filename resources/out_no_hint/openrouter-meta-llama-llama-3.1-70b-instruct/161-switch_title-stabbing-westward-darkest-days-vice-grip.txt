I'm stuck in this vice grip
Can't escape the pain I inflict
I'm searching for a way to break free
But it's hard to resist the misery

I'm crawling through the darkest days
Trying to find my way
But it's hard to see the light
When the darkness feels just right

I'm trying to escape the vice grip
But it's got a hold on me
I'm searching for a way to break free
But it's hard to resist the misery
