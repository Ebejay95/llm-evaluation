"In the silence, I hear your voice
Whispers of memories, a haunting choice
To hold on to the past, or let go
A bittersweet reminder, of what we used to know

In the shadows, I see your face
A fleeting glimpse, of a forgotten place
Where love and laughter, once filled the air
Now only echoes, of a love that's rare

I'm left to wonder, where did we go wrong?
Was it something I said, or a love that was too strong?
The questions linger, like a ghost in my mind
A constant reminder, of a love left behind

In the silence, I hear your voice
Whispers of memories, a haunting choice
To hold on to the past, or let go
A bittersweet reminder, of what we used to know"
