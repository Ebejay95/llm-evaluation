"In the heat of the night
I'll be searching for the light
In the heat of the night
I'll be searching for the light

I've been walking through the night
Trying to find my way to the light
I've been searching for a guiding star
To lead me through the dark

In the heat of the night
I'll be searching for the light
In the heat of the night
I'll be searching for the light

I've been trying to find my way
Through the darkness of the day
I've been searching for a shining light
To lead me through the night

In the heat of the night
I'll be searching for the light
In the heat of the night
I'll be searching for the light"
