I couldn't find any lyrics for "Clone Your Lover" or "God Bless the Models" by Drake. It's possible that these songs don't exist or are not well-known.

However, I can suggest some popular songs by Drake that you might be interested in:

* "God's Plan"
* "One Dance"
* "Hotline Bling"
* "In My Feelings"

If you provide me with the correct song title, I can try to provide you with the lyrics.
