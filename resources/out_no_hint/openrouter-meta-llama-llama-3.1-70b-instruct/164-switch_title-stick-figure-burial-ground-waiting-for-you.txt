I'm stuck in the moment, can't get out of my head
The memories of you, they linger on instead
I'm searching for a light, a guiding star
To lead me through the darkness, near and far

I'm waiting for you, I'm waiting for the day
When I'll see your smile, and drive the blues away
I'm waiting for you, I'm waiting for the night
When I'll hold you close, and everything's alright

In the burial ground, where the wild things play
I'll be waiting for you, every single day
I'll be waiting for you, until the end of time
When I'll see your face, and know that you're mine
