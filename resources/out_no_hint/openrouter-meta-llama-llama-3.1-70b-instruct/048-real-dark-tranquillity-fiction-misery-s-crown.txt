In the hollow of my soul, a spark remains
A dying ember of a love that still sustains
The weight of my regret, a burden to atone
A longing to redeem, to make it back to home

In the silence, I hear your voice
A whispered promise, a haunting choice
To follow the shadows, to flee from the light
To lose myself in the darkness of the night

Misery's crown, a heavy weight to bear
A constant reminder of the love we once shared
A bittersweet reminder of what could never be
A longing to turn back time, to set my soul free

In the hollow of my soul, a spark remains
A dying ember of a love that still sustains
The weight of my regret, a burden to atone
A longing to redeem, to make it back to home
