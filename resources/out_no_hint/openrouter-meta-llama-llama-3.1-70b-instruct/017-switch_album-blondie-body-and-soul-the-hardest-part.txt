In the dark of the night, I'll be searching for the light
In the dark of the night, I'll be searching for the light
Body and soul, I'm gonna make you mine
Body and soul, I'm gonna make you mine

In the dark of the night, I'll be searching for the light
In the dark of the night, I'll be searching for the light
Body and soul, I'm gonna make you mine
Body and soul, I'm gonna make you mine

The hardest part, is letting go
The hardest part, is letting go
The hardest part, is letting go
The hardest part, is letting go
