I am nemesis, the one that you can't define
A force so relentless, it will leave you blind
I am the darkness that you can't escape
The one that haunts your every waking shape

I am the shadow that you can't define
The one that's always one step ahead of time
I am the chaos that you can't control
The one that's gonna take its toll

I am nemesis, the one that you can't ignore
A force so powerful, it will leave you poor
I am the darkness that you can't evade
The one that's gonna make you feel afraid

I am the edge of black, the point of no return
The one that's gonna make you yearn
To go back to the light, to go back to the start
But it's too late, you're already in my heart
