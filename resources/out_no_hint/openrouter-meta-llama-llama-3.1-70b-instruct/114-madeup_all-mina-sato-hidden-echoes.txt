In the silence, I hear your voice
A whispered promise, a heartfelt choice
To follow the echoes, that only I can see
A hidden world, where you and I used to be

In the stillness, I feel your touch
A gentle breeze, that rustles so much
The leaves of memories, that we used to share
A bittersweet reminder, of the love we once dared

In the darkness, I see your face
A fleeting glimpse, of a love that time won't erase
A hidden echo, that only I can hear
A whispered promise, that you'll always be near
