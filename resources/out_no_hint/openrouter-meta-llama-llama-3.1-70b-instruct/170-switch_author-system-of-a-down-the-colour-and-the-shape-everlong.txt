"Hello, I've waited here for you
Everlong
Tonight, I throw myself into
And out of the red
Out of her head, she sang
Come to decide that the things that I tried
Were in my life just to get high
Now think I'm doing all right
Hello, I've waited here for you
Everlong
Tonight, I throw myself into
And out of the red
Out of her head, she sang
Come to decide that the things that I tried
Were in my life just to get high
Now think I'm doing all right
Hello, I've waited here for you
Everlong
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You've got to promise not to stop when I say when
Everlong
Everlong
Everlong
Everlong"
