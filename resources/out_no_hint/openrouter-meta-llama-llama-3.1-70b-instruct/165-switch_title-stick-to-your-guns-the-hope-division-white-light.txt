"We're the product of a broken home
A generation lost and alone
We're the children of a dying breed
But we won't back down, we won't give in

We'll rise up, we'll take the power back
We'll shine so bright, like a beacon in the black
We'll be the light, in the dark of night
We'll be the hope, that shines so bright

We'll stand as one, united we'll stand
With our fists raised high, we'll take back our land
We'll fight for what's right, we'll fight for what's just
We'll be the change, that we've been searching for, we trust

We'll be the light, that shines so bright
We'll be the hope, that guides us through the night
We'll be the ones, that make a difference
We'll be the change, that we've been searching for, we'll make it happen"
