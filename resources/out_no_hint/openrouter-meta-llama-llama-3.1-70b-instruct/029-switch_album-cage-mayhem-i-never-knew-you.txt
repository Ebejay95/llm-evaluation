I never knew you, I never knew you
I never knew you, I never knew you

I was lost in the moment, I was lost in the haze
I was searching for answers, but they were hard to amaze
I was chasing the highs, but the lows were my fate
I was running from the truth, but it was always too late

I never knew you, I never knew you
I never knew you, I never knew you

I was blinded by the darkness, I was deaf to the sound
I was numb to the feeling, I was lost in the crowd
I was searching for a purpose, but it was hard to be found
I was trying to escape, but I was stuck in this town

I never knew you, I never knew you
I never knew you, I never knew you
