I walk a lonely road
The only one that I have ever known
Don't know where it goes
But it's home to me, I walk this empty street
On the boulevard of broken dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the king of pain

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone

Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah

I'm walking down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the border line
Of the edge and where I roam

Read between the lines
What's messed up and everything you'll find
Is all that you've left behind

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone

Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah

I walk alone, I walk alone
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone
