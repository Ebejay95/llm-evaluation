"Goodbye" by Alannah Myles:

I'm gonna miss you, I'm gonna miss you
I'm gonna miss you, I'm gonna miss you

You're gonna leave me, you're gonna leave me
You're gonna leave me, you're gonna leave me

I'm gonna miss you, I'm gonna miss you
I'm gonna miss you, I'm gonna miss you

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

(Note: I couldn't find any song by Slipknot with the title "Goodbye". The song "Goodbye" is actually by Alannah Myles. If you're looking for a different song, please let me know)
