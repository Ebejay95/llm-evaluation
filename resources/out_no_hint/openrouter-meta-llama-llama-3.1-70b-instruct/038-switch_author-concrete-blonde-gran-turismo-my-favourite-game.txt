I'm not aware of any song by Concrete Blonde titled "Gran Turismo" or "My Favourite Game". Concrete Blonde is a band known for their song "Joey" and other hits, but I couldn't find any information about these specific song titles.

However, I did find that "My Favourite Game" is a song by The Cardigans. Here are the lyrics:

Do you have a Clue what you're doing
Do you have a clue what you're doing
Do you have a clue what you're doing
Do you have a clue what you're doing

You're my favourite game
You're my favourite game

Do you have a clue what you're doing
Do you have a clue what you're doing
Do you have a clue what you're doing
Do you have a clue what you're doing

You're my favourite game
You're my favourite game
