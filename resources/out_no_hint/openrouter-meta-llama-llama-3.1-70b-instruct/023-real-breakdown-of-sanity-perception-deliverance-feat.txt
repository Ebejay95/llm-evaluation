"I'm lost in the haze of my own mind
A world of chaos, I'm left behind
The lines are blurred, the truth is rare
I'm searching for a glimpse, a shred of care

In the depths of my soul, a fire burns
A flame that flickers, a light that yearns
To guide me through, the darkest night
To lead me to, the morning light

But the demons they whisper, they scream my name
A cacophony, a chaotic game
They try to break me, to shatter my will
But I won't back down, I won't stand still

I'll rise up, I'll take the fight
I'll shine a light, in the dark of night
I'll find my way, through the stormy sea
I'll rise above, I'll be free"
