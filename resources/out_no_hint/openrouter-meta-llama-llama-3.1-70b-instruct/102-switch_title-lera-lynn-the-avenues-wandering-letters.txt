I'm lost in the avenues of your mind
Where the streets are lined with wandering letters
And the words that we left behind
Are the only things that remain

In the silence, I hear your voice
Whispers in the dead of night
A lonely echo, a haunting choice
To follow the shadows, to follow the light

I'm searching for a ghost in the night
A flicker of hope, a dying light
A whispered promise, a heartfelt sigh
A love that's lost, a love that's died

In the avenues of your mind
I'm lost, I'm blind, I'm left behind
