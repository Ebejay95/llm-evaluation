Lost in the haze of a fading light
The city's awake, but it's not alright
I'm searching for solace, a place to reside
Where the ghosts of my past won't collide

In the paper skylines, I see your face
A fleeting memory, a distant place
I'm chasing the highs, but the lows are my guide
Through the city's veins, I'll wander and hide

The streets are alive, but they're not my home
I'm just a stranger, in a world that's not my own
I'm trying to find my way, through the dark of the night
To a place where the shadows won't ignite

In the paper skylines, I see your face
A fleeting memory, a distant place
I'm chasing the highs, but the lows are my guide
Through the city's veins, I'll wander and hide
