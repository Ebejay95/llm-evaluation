"In the willows, we'll find our home
Where the wild things are, we'll never be alone
In the willows, we'll find our way
Through the darkness, into a brand new day

We'll chase the sun, we'll dance in the rain
We'll find our solace, we'll ease our pain
In the willows, we'll find our peace
Where the wild things are, our hearts will release

When will we surrender, to the love we've found?
When will we surrender, to the hearts that beat around?
In the willows, we'll find our home
Where the wild things are, we'll never be alone"
