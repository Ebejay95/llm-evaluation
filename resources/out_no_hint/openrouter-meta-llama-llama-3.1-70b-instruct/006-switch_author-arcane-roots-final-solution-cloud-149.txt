I'm stuck in the haze of a love that's lost its way
And I'm searching for a light, a guiding star to lead the day
I'm trying to find my place, but it's hard to breathe
When the weight of the world is crushing me

I'm chasing the highs, but the lows are all I find
And I'm trying to escape, but I'm running out of time
I'm searching for a cure, a remedy for my pain
But it's hard to heal when the wound remains

I'm lost in the clouds, I'm drifting away
I'm searching for a lifeline, a beacon to lead the way
I'm trying to find my voice, but the words won't come
And I'm left with nothing, but the echoes of what's been done

I'm stuck in the haze, of a love that's lost its way
And I'm searching for a light, a guiding star to lead the day
