I couldn't find any lyrics for "Hourglass" by Mr Little Jeans that match "Ashes Of The Wake" (which is actually an album by Lamb of God). However, I can provide you with the lyrics for "Ashes of the Wake" by Lamb of God, or "Hourglass" by Mr Little Jeans. Please let me know which one you would like.

If you would like "Hourglass" by Mr Little Jeans:
 
I'm stuck in the hourglass
Got my feet on the ground
But my head is spinning round
I'm stuck in the hourglass
Got my feet on the ground
But my head is spinning round

If you would like "Ashes of the Wake" by Lamb of God:
 
Ashes of the wake, the end of the line
Ashes of the wake, the end of the line
Ashes of the wake, the end of the line
Ashes of the wake, the end of the line
