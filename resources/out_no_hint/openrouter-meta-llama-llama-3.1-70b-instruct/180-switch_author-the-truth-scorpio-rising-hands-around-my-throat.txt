I'm searching for the truth
But it's hard when you're lying to me
I'm trying to find my way
But it's hard when you're leading me astray

You're a Scorpio rising
The truth is hard to define
You're a master of disguise
But I can see the danger signs

You've got your hands around my throat
And I can feel the pressure rise
You're squeezing tight, it's hard to breathe
And I can feel my heart divide
