I'm a lonesome cowboy, ridin' through the night
The stars up above, they're my only light
I've been from Tucson to Tucumcari
Tehachapi to Tonapah
Driven every kind of rig that ever was made
Driven the back roads so I wouldn't get weighed
And if you give me weed, whites, and wine
And you show me a sign
I'll be willin' to be movin'
