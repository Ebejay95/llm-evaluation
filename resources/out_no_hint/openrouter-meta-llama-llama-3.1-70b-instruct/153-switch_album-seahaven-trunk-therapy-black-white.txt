"I'm stuck in the haze of my own mistakes
I'm searching for a way to escape
The ghosts that I've made, they whisper my name
A constant reminder of the pain

I'm trying to find my way through the dark
But it's hard to see when you're lost in your heart
I'm reaching out for a hand to hold
But it's hard to find when you're growing old

Black and white, it's all I see
A world that's lost its color, lost its glee
I'm trying to find my way back home
But it's hard to find when you're not alone

I'm stuck in the haze of my own mistakes
I'm searching for a way to escape
The ghosts that I've made, they whisper my name
A constant reminder of the pain"
