"Lost in the haze of a fading dream
 Memories of you, they still remain
Echoes of love, whispers of pain
Fading away, like the morning rain

In the silence, I hear your voice
A whispered promise, a heartfelt choice
To follow the path, where love will lead
Through the shadows, where darkness feeds

 Memories of you, they still remain
Echoes of love, whispers of pain
Fading away, like the morning rain

In the stillness, I feel your touch
A gentle caress, a loving clutch
A flame that burns, a heart that beats
A love that's lost, in the dark of the streets

 Memories of you, they still remain
Echoes of love, whispers of pain
Fading away, like the morning rain

In the emptiness, I search for you
A fleeting glimpse, a moment's truth
A memory that, forever will stay
A bittersweet reminder, of love that's gone away"
