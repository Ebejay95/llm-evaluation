"In the shadow of the night
I see your face, a wicked delight
A whispered promise, a wicked game
We'll dance with the devil, we'll play with the flame

Lucifer rising, the morning star
A fallen angel, near and far
In the darkness, we'll find our way
Through the shadows, to a brand new day

In the silence, I hear your voice
A whispered secret, a wicked choice
A forbidden fruit, a taste so sweet
We'll take the leap, our hearts will beat

Lucifer rising, the morning star
A fallen angel, near and far
In the darkness, we'll find our way
Through the shadows, to a brand new day"
