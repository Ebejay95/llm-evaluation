"In the silence, I hear your voice
Whispers in the dark, a haunting choice
To follow the echoes, to chase the pain
To find the truth, to love again

In the shadows, I see your face
A fleeting glimpse, a haunted place
Where memories linger, where love resides
Where the heart beats, where the soul hides

Aurora letters, written in the night
A message from the heart, a beacon light
Guiding me through, the darkest sea
To find my way, to you and me

In the stillness, I feel your touch
A gentle breeze, a loving clutch
That holds me close, that sets me free
To find my heart, to find me"
