I'm lost in the haze of my own demise
A world of my own, where the darkness resides
I'm searching for a light, a guiding star
To lead me through the night, near and far

I'm chasing the highs, but the lows are my home
I'm trying to find my way, but I'm never alone
The ghosts that I've made, they whisper my name
And I'm forever changed, by the flames

I'm trying to break free, from this endless fight
But the darkness it calls, and it feels like home tonight
I'm reaching for the light, but it's slipping away
And I'm left with the shadows, to face another day

I'm lost in the haze, of my own demise
A world of my own, where the darkness resides
I'm searching for a light, a guiding star
To lead me through the night, near and far
