In twilight's hush, where shadows play
Amidst the trees, a whispered sway
A midnight breeze that gently stirs
The emerald dreams that in slumber blur

In secret places, hidden deep
Where ancient magic softly creep
The whispers weave a mystic spell
That only in the heart can dwell

The moon's pale light upon the sea
A path of silver, beckoning me
To follow dreams that in the night
Take flight, and in the darkness take their light

In emerald dreams, I find my way
Through labyrinths of a mystic day
Where the horizon meets the sky
And the neon lights of wonder why
