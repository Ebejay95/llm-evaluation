"In the crimson scenes, I see your face
A fleeting memory, a distant place
Where shadows dance, and darkness reigns
I'm searching for the truth, but it remains

A black line, a divide, a choice to make
Between the light and the darkness that I create
I'm trying to escape, but it's hard to break
The chains that bind me, the heart that aches

In the crimson scenes, I see your eyes
A reflection of the tears I've cried
A reminder of the love that's lost
A memory that forever will be the cost"
