"In the stillness, I hear your voice
A whispered warning, a haunting choice
To follow the echoes, or to find my own
In the silence, I am not alone

The shadows they whisper, the darkness it speaks
A language of lies, a tongue that it seeks
To deceive and to manipulate, to control and to claim
But I will not be swayed, I will not be tamed

In the silence, I find my strength
A resolve that's born, a will that's length
To stand against the darkness, to shine like the light
To be the beacon, in the black of night

The whispers they fade, the silence it breaks
As I rise up, and my voice it makes
A declaration of freedom, a shout to the sky
I am awakened, I will not be denied"
