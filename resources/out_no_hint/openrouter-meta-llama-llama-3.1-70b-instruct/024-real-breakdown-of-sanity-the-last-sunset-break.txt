"I'm lost in the haze of my own demise
A world that's moving fast, I'm stuck in time
I'm searching for a light, a guiding star
To lead me through the dark, near and far

I'm chasing the ghosts, that I've made
Trying to find my way, through the shades
I'm running from the pain, that I've known
But it's always one step, ahead of me, back home

This is the breakdown, of my sanity
The last sunset, I'll ever see
This is the breakdown, of my humanity
The last breath, I'll ever breathe

I'm falling apart, at the seams
I'm losing my grip, on my dreams
I'm slipping away, into the night
And I don't know, if I'll be alright

This is the breakdown, of my sanity
The last sunset, I'll ever see
This is the breakdown, of my humanity
The last breath, I'll ever breathe"
