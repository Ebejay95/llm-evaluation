"In the city of lost souls, where shadows play
A midnight serenade, to guide you on your way
The ghosts of love and sorrow, they whisper through the night
A melancholy waltz, to keep you from the light

In the fever rooms, where dreams are made
The orchestra of shadows, they serenade
The fragments of your heart, they echo through the pain
A symphony of longing, to drive you insane

In the city of lost dreams, where love has gone astray
The fever rooms orchestra, they play all night and day
A requiem for the heart, that beats no more
A funeral march, to the door

Of the room where love resides, where shadows come to play
The fever rooms orchestra, they whisper through the day
A lullaby of sorrow, to guide you on your way
To the city of lost souls, where shadows play"
