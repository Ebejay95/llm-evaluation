There's an infestation in my mind
It's where the demon you know you're supposed to hate
But your brain gets rewired
And suddenly you're playing with it
It's like a game with your head, it's awful
I feel possessed when the day gets still
I'm a hazard to myself, don't let me get in my zone
I'm a hazard to myself, don't let me get in my zone
