"In the silence, I hear your voice
Whispers in the dark of the night
A mysterious call, a siren's choice
To follow the heart, to follow the light

In the stillness, I feel your touch
A gentle breeze that soothes the soul
A whispered promise, a heartfelt clutch
To hold on tight, to make me whole

Found in far away places
Where the heart beats, where love embraces
In the silence, I hear your voice
Whispers in the dark of the night

In the shadows, I see your face
A fleeting glance, a secret place
A hidden truth, a mysterious pace
To follow the heart, to find my way

Found in far away places
Where the heart beats, where love embraces
In the silence, I hear your voice
Whispers in the dark of the night

Who am I, where do I belong?
A question that echoes, a heart that's strong
A search for identity, a journey to be free
To find myself, to find my destiny

Found in far away places
Where the heart beats, where love embraces
In the silence, I hear your voice
Whispers in the dark of the night"
