"In the dark of the night, I see your face
A beauty that's hard to replace
A fleeting dream, a moment's peace
A fiction that my heart can't release

Your eyes, they shine like stars up high
A celestial show, as the world goes by
Your touch, it sets my soul on fire
A burning flame, that never tires

In the dark of the night, I feel your skin
A gentle caress, that draws me in
A beauty that's hard to define
A fiction that's forever mine"
