"Sooner or later, we'll be face to face
And I'll be the one to make you see
That I'm not the one to blame
For the pain that you've been through

Sooner or later, we'll be standing tall
And I'll be the one to make you fall
From the pedestal that you've built
For the lies that you've been told

Sooner or later, we'll be standing here
And I'll be the one to wipe away your tears
And I'll be the one to make you see
That I'm not the one to blame

Sooner or later, we'll be standing tall
And I'll be the one to make you fall
From the pedestal that you've built
For the lies that you've been told

Sooner or later, we'll be standing here
And I'll be the one to wipe away your tears
And I'll be the one to make you see
That I'm not the one to blame

Sooner or later, we'll be standing tall
And I'll be the one to make you fall
From the pedestal that you've built
For the lies that you've been told

Sooner or later, we'll be standing here
And I'll be the one to wipe away your tears
And I'll be the one to make you see
That I'm not the one to blame"
