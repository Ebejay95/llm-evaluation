In the hollow of my chest, a void resides
A chasm deep, where love and hope have died
The weight of every word, a burden to bear
A fragile heart, that's lost its way to repair

The ghosts of what we had, they whisper my name
Echoes of a love, that's lost in the flames
I'm searching for a light, in this darkest night
A guiding star, to lead me through the fight

For broken words, I'm left to atone
A silence that's deafening, a heart that's turned to stone
The memories of you, they linger on
A bittersweet reminder, of what's been and gone
