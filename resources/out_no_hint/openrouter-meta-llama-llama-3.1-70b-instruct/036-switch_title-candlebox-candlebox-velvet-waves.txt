"Far behind, I've left my home
And I'm drifting, drifting, drifting
I'm drifting, drifting, drifting
Far behind, I've left my home

In the velvet waves, I'm lost at sea
In the velvet waves, I'm lost at sea
In the velvet waves, I'm lost at sea
In the velvet waves, I'm lost at sea

Far behind, I've left my home
And I'm drifting, drifting, drifting
I'm drifting, drifting, drifting
Far behind, I've left my home

In the velvet waves, I'm lost at sea
In the velvet waves, I'm lost at sea
In the velvet waves, I'm lost at sea
In the velvet waves, I'm lost at sea"
