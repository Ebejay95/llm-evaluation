"In the silence, I hear your voice
A whispered promise, a heartfelt choice
To chase the sun, to dance in the rain
To find solace in the endless gardens we sustain

In the stillness, I feel your touch
A gentle breeze, a loving clutch
That guides me through, the darkest night
And leads me to, the skylines of our delight

We'll wander free, through the city's roar
And find our peace, on the outskirts once more
Where the world slows down, and love resides
In the endless gardens, where our hearts abide"
