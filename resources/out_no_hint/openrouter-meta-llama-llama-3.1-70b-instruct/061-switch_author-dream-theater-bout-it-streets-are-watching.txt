I couldn't find any song by Dream Theater with the title "Bout It" or "Streets Are Watching". Dream Theater is a progressive metal band known for their complex and lengthy songs, and I couldn't find any match for these titles in their discography.

However, I found that "Streets Is Watching" is a song by Jay-Z, from his 1997 album "In My Lifetime, Vol. 1". If you're interested, I can provide you with the lyrics.

Additionally, I found that "Bout It" is a song by Jay-Z, from his 1996 album "Reasonable Doubt". If you're interested, I can provide you with the lyrics.

Please let me know if you would like me to provide the lyrics for either of these songs.
