I couldn't find any lyrics for "Kav, Dirty Rejects (feat. Zombie Boy), White Room". If you can provide more context or details, I'll try to help.

However, I can suggest that the song "White Room" is actually by Cream, and here are the lyrics:

In the white room with black curtains near the station
Black roof country, no gold pavements, tired starlings
Silver horses ran down moonbeams in your dark eyes
Dawnlight smiles on you leaving, my contentment
