"In the silence, I hear your voice
Whispers in the dark, a haunted choice
A siren's call, that beckons me
To follow you, into the mystery

In the stillness, I feel your touch
A ghostly caress, that means so much
A whispered promise, that sets me free
To sail the seas, of destiny

Paper waves, they crash on the shore
A fragile beauty, that I adore
A delicate dance, of love and pain
A bittersweet refrain, that remains

In the silence, I hear your voice
Whispers in the dark, a haunted choice
A siren's call, that beckons me
To follow you, into the mystery"
