"Wah gwaan, me dear, it's time to have no fear
Babylon a come, but we nah go shed no tear
We'll rise up, we'll take the power back
We'll show dem we're stronger, we'll never look back

Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
Can stop us now, we're on the move
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
Can stop us now, we're breaking through

We're the voice of the voiceless, we're the choice of the brave
We're the ones who'll take the power, we'll never be enslaved
We'll rise up, we'll take the power back
We'll show dem we're stronger, we'll never look back

Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
Can stop us now, we're on the move
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
Can stop us now, we're breaking through"
