"I see the way you're looking at me
I know you're trying to get to me
I see the way you're moving in
I know you're trying to get under my skin

Maybe memories can be erased
Maybe memories can be erased
Maybe memories can be erased
Maybe memories can be erased

I see the way you're looking at me
I know you're trying to get to me
I see the way you're moving in
I know you're trying to get under my skin

Maybe memories can be erased
Maybe memories can be erased
Maybe memories can be erased
Maybe memories can be erased

I'm trying to get away from you
I'm trying to get away from you
I'm trying to get away from you
I'm trying to get away from you

Maybe memories can be erased
Maybe memories can be erased
Maybe memories can be erased
Maybe memories can be erased

I see the way you're looking at me
I know you're trying to get to me
I see the way you're moving in
I know you're trying to get under my skin"
