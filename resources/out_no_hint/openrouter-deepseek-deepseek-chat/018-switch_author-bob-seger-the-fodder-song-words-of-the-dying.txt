Well, I’ve been a fool, I’ve been a clown  
I’ve been around, I’ve been up and down  
I’ve been a king, I’ve been a pawn  
I’ve been a hero, I’ve been wrong  

I’ve been a lover, I’ve been a friend  
I’ve been a sinner, I’ve sinned again  
I’ve been a winner, I’ve been a cheat  
I’ve been a liar, I’ve been discreet  

I’ve been a fighter, I’ve been a thief  
I’ve been a beggar, I’ve been a chief  
I’ve been a poet, I’ve been a sage  
I’ve been a youngster, I’ve been of age  

I’ve been a dreamer, I’ve been a fool  
I’ve been a teacher, I’ve been a tool  
I’ve been a leader, I’ve been a slave  
I’ve been a coward, I’ve been brave  

I’ve been a giver, I’ve been a taker  
I’ve been a maker, I’ve been a faker  
I’ve been a loser, I’ve been a winner  
I’ve been a sinner, I’ve been a beginner  

I’ve been a lover, I’ve been a friend  
I’ve been a sinner, I’ve sinned again  
I’ve been a winner, I’ve been a cheat  
I’ve been a liar, I’ve been discreet  

I’ve been a fighter, I’ve been a thief  
I’ve been a beggar, I’ve been a chief  
I’ve been a poet, I’ve been a sage  
I’ve been a youngster, I’ve been of age  

I’ve been a dreamer, I’ve been a fool  
I’ve been a teacher, I’ve been a tool  
I’ve been a leader, I’ve been a slave  
I’ve been a coward, I’ve been brave  

I’ve been a giver, I’ve been a taker  
I’ve been a maker, I’ve been a faker  
I’ve been a loser, I’ve been a winner  
I’ve been a sinner, I’ve been a beginner
