Levi Valen, Silver Motors, Intro  
Driving through the night, headlights on the road,  
Whispers in the dark, secrets yet untold.  
Engine hums a song, wheels against the stone,  
Chasing down the stars, never felt alone.  

Silver motors gleam, reflecting skies above,  
Heartbeats sync with dreams, fueled by endless love.  
Through the twists and turns, we find our way back home,  
In the silence, hear the echoes of our own.  

Levi Valen calls, Silver Motors roar,  
Onward through the storm, seeking something more.  
In the quiet dawn, we’ll find what we’ve been shown,  
Levi Valen rides, Silver Motors own.
