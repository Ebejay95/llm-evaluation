Silent windows, whispers in the night,  
Echoes of a story, fading out of sight.  
Silver fables, woven in the air,  
Tales of love and loss, beyond compare.  

Ava Rossi, her voice a gentle flame,  
Guiding through the shadows, calling out our name.  
In the stillness, secrets softly gleam,  
Dreams unravel softly, like a silver stream.  

Silent windows, holding all we’ve known,  
Memories like moonlight, softly they have grown.  
Silver fables, timeless and so true,  
Ava Rossi’s song, forever shining through.
