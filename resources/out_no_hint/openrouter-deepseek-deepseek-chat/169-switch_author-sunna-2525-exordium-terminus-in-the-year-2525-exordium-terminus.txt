In the year 2525, if man is still alive
If woman can survive, they may find
In the year 3535, ain't gonna need to tell the truth, tell no lies
Everything you think, do, and say
Is in the pill you took today
In the year 4545, you ain't gonna need your teeth, won't need your eyes
You won't find a thing to chew
Nobody's gonna look at you
In the year 5555, your arms are hanging limp at your sides
Your legs got nothing to do
Some machine's doing that for you
In the year 6565, you won't need no husband, won't need no wife
You'll pick your son, pick your daughter too
From the bottom of a long glass tube
In the year 7510, if God's a-coming, he ought to make it by then
Maybe he'll look around himself and say
"Guess it's time for the judgment day"
In the year 8510, God is gonna shake his mighty head
He'll either say, "I'm pleased where man has been"
Or tear it down and start again
In the year 9595, I'm kinda wondering if man is gonna be alive
He's taken everything this old earth can give
And he ain't put back nothing
Now it's been 10,000 years, man has cried a billion tears
For what he never knew, now man's reign is through
But through eternal night, the twinkling of starlight
So very far away, maybe it's only yesterday
In the year 2525, if man is still alive
If woman can survive, they may find
In the year 3535, ain't gonna need to tell the truth, tell no lies
Everything you think, do, and say
Is in the pill you took today
In the year 4545, you ain't gonna need your teeth, won't need your eyes
You won't find a thing to chew
Nobody's gonna look at you
