Milo Fischer, Electric Stories  
Whispers in the wires, tales untold  
A spark in the dark, a heart of gold  
Through the static, we find our way  
In the silence, we hear what they say  

Electric stories, lighting up the night  
Milo Fischer, guiding us with light  
Through the circuits, we’re intertwined  
In the echoes, our souls aligned  

Flickers of memory, shadows of the past  
Moments of wonder, built to last  
In the hum of the current, we find our song  
Milo Fischer, where we belong  

Electric stories, lighting up the night  
Milo Fischer, guiding us with light  
Through the circuits, we’re intertwined  
In the echoes, our souls aligned  

In the glow of the neon, we see the truth  
Milo Fischer, the fountain of youth  
Through the wires, we’re forever bound  
In the electric stories, we’re found  

Electric stories, lighting up the night  
Milo Fischer, guiding us with light  
Through the circuits, we’re intertwined  
In the echoes, our souls aligned
