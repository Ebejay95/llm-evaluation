Hednoize, 22-09-12 Off, Crushed  
Lost in the static, voices fade away  
Echoes of silence, the night turns to gray  
Crushed under pressure, the weight of the fall  
No one to catch me, no one at all  

Shadows are creeping, they swallow the light  
Dreams turn to ashes, they vanish from sight  
Off in the distance, a flicker of hope  
But it’s just an illusion, a way to cope  

Hednoize, 22-09-12 Off, Crushed  
The world keeps spinning, but I’m standing still  
Caught in the chaos, I’ve lost my will  
Crushed by the silence, the void in my chest  
Searching for meaning, but there’s no rest  

Hednoize, 22-09-12 Off, Crushed  
The clock keeps ticking, the hours drag on  
Memories fading, the past is gone  
Off in the darkness, I’m searching for peace  
But the noise never ceases, it won’t release  

Hednoize, 22-09-12 Off, Crushed  
Crushed by the weight of the world I bear  
Lost in the silence, no one is there  
Off in the distance, a glimmer of light  
But it’s just a mirage, fading from sight  

Hednoize, 22-09-12 Off, Crushed  
The noise surrounds me, it’s all I hear  
A constant reminder of all I fear  
Crushed by the pressure, I’m breaking inside  
Searching for solace, but it’s denied  

Hednoize, 22-09-12 Off, Crushed  
The night is endless, the dawn won’t come  
Lost in the shadows, I’m overcome  
Off in the silence, I’m calling your name  
But the echoes are empty, it’s all the same  

Hednoize, 22-09-12 Off, Crushed  
Crushed by the weight of the world I bear  
Lost in the silence, no one is there  
Off in the distance, a glimmer of light  
But it’s just a mirage, fading from sight
