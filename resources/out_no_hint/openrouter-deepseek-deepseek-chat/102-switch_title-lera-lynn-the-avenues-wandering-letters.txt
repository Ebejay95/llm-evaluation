Wandering letters, they find their way
Through the cracks in the walls, through the night and the day
They carry the weight of the words unsaid
From the depths of the heart to the edge of the bed

The avenues whisper, they call your name
Through the shadows and light, through the joy and the pain
They lead to the places where the lost ones roam
Where the echoes of love still find their home

Wandering letters, they never rest
They travel the distance, they pass the test
They carry the stories of the ones who dare
To send them out into the open air

The avenues whisper, they call your name
Through the shadows and light, through the joy and the pain
They lead to the places where the lost ones roam
Where the echoes of love still find their home

Wandering letters, they never fade
They carry the truth in the promises made
They travel the world, they cross the sea
To bring back the love that was meant to be

The avenues whisper, they call your name
Through the shadows and light, through the joy and the pain
They lead to the places where the lost ones roam
Where the echoes of love still find their home
