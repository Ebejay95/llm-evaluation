Well, it's happy hour, let's all unwind
Pour a little something to ease your mind
The week is done, it's time to play
Let the music take your cares away

Bop til you drop, don't you stop
Shake it loose, let the rhythm pop
From the jukebox to the dance floor
We're gonna rock until we can't no more

The Hillbilly Moon is shining bright
Underneath the neon light
We're all here to have some fun
So grab your partner, everyone

Bop til you drop, don't you stop
Shake it loose, let the rhythm pop
From the jukebox to the dance floor
We're gonna rock until we can't no more

So raise your glass, let's toast the night
Everything's gonna be alright
With a little music and a lot of cheer
Happy hour's the best time of the year

Bop til you drop, don't you stop
Shake it loose, let the rhythm pop
From the jukebox to the dance floor
We're gonna rock until we can't no more

Bop til you drop, don't you stop
Shake it loose, let the rhythm pop
From the jukebox to the dance floor
We're gonna rock until we can't no more
