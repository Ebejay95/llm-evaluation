In the glow of the neon haze,
Where the city whispers through the maze,
Digital shadows dance and play,
In the heart of the night, they sway.

Aurora dreams in electric streams,
Colors burst in silent screams,
Through the wires, the visions beam,
In the void, we find our theme.

Echoes of a world unseen,
Where the past and future convene,
In the code, we’re all serene,
Lost in the digital machine.

Aurora dreams in electric streams,
Colors burst in silent screams,
Through the wires, the visions beam,
In the void, we find our theme.

Shadows merge, the lines dissolve,
In the pulse, we evolve,
From the static, we absolve,
In the rhythm, we revolve.

Aurora dreams in electric streams,
Colors burst in silent screams,
Through the wires, the visions beam,
In the void, we find our theme.

In the silence, we’re alive,
In the data, we survive,
Digital shadows, we thrive,
In the night, we come alive.
