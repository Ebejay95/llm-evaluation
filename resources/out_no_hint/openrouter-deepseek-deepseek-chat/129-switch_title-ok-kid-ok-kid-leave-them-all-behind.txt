OK KID, leave them all behind
The weight of the world, it’s not yours to find
OK KID, let it all unwind
The chains that bind, they’re not your design

OK KID, step into the light
The shadows fade, they lose their fight
OK KID, take your own flight
The stars align, they guide your night

Leave them all behind, the doubts, the fears
The echoes of the past, they disappear
Leave them all behind, the tears, the pain
A new horizon calls, it’s in your name

OK KID, the future’s in your hands
The map is blank, it’s yours to plan
OK KID, you’ll understand
The journey’s yours, it’s where you stand

Leave them all behind, the doubts, the fears
The echoes of the past, they disappear
Leave them all behind, the tears, the pain
A new horizon calls, it’s in your name

OK KID, leave them all behind
The weight of the world, it’s not yours to find
OK KID, let it all unwind
The chains that bind, they’re not your design
