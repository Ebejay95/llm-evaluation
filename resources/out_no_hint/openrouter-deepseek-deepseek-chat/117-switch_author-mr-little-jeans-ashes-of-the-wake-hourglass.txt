Ashes of the wake, the hourglass spills  
Time is a thief, it takes what it wills  
We’re chasing shadows, we’re losing the fight  
The sands keep falling, they slip out of sight  

The echoes linger, they whisper our fate  
We’re bound to the rhythm, we’re bound to the weight  
The hourglass turns, the ashes remain  
We’re caught in the cycle, we’re lost in the flame
