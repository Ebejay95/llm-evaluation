(Verse 1)  
Late nights, neon lights, we’re chasing the sound,  
City whispers, we’re lost but we’re never bound.  
Every corner’s a story, every face is a clue,  
In this maze of the moment, I’m running with you.  

(Chorus)  
Unpredictable, we’re golden letters in the sky,  
Dancing through the chaos, never asking why.  
Sunglasses on, we’re living in the glow,  
Every step’s a mystery, where we’ll go, we don’t know.  

(Verse 2)  
The rhythm of the streets, it’s calling our name,  
No map, no plan, just a flickering flame.  
We’re the dreamers, the drifters, the ones who believe,  
In the magic of the night, in the air we breathe.  

(Chorus)  
Unpredictable, we’re golden letters in the sky,  
Dancing through the chaos, never asking why.  
Sunglasses on, we’re living in the glow,  
Every step’s a mystery, where we’ll go, we don’t know.  

(Bridge)  
Time slips like sand, but we’re holding it tight,  
In the shadows and the sparks, we’re infinite tonight.  
No regrets, no retreat, just the beat in our veins,  
We’re the echoes of the city, breaking all the chains.  

(Chorus)  
Unpredictable, we’re golden letters in the sky,  
Dancing through the chaos, never asking why.  
Sunglasses on, we’re living in the glow,  
Every step’s a mystery, where we’ll go, we don’t know.  

(Outro)  
Sunglasses on, we’re lost in the flow,  
Unpredictable hearts, where we’ll go, we don’t know.
