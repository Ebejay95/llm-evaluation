Golden rooms, paper skylines, lights  
Flicker in the distance, soft and bright  
Whispers of the city, hums at night  
We’re lost in the glow, out of sight  

Windows frame the world, a fleeting view  
Moments caught in amber, me and you  
Threads of conversation, old and new  
Tangled in the air, a quiet hue  

Golden rooms, paper skylines, lights  
Hold us in their arms, through the nights  
Dreams are woven in the city’s seams  
Fading softly, like distant streams  

Time unravels, slow and sweet  
Footsteps echo down the street  
We’re fragments of a larger scene  
Bound together, yet unseen  

Golden rooms, paper skylines, lights  
Guide us through the dark, hold us tight  
In the quiet, we find our way  
Through the shadows, night to day
