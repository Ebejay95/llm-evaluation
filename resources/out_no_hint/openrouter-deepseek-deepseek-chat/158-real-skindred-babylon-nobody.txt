Here we go again, another day
Same old story, same old way
They try to keep us down, but we won't stay
We rise above, we find our way

Nobody gonna break us down
Nobody gonna turn us around
Nobody gonna push us to the ground
We stand tall, we make our sound

Babylon, Babylon, we see your game
Babylon, Babylon, we know your name
Babylon, Babylon, we won't be tamed
Babylon, Babylon, we break the chain

Here we go again, another fight
Same old battle, same old plight
They try to dim our light, but we ignite
We burn bright, we take our right

Nobody gonna break us down
Nobody gonna turn us around
Nobody gonna push us to the ground
We stand tall, we make our sound

Babylon, Babylon, we see your game
Babylon, Babylon, we know your name
Babylon, Babylon, we won't be tamed
Babylon, Babylon, we break the chain

Here we go again, another day
Same old story, same old way
They try to keep us down, but we won't stay
We rise above, we find our way

Nobody gonna break us down
Nobody gonna turn us around
Nobody gonna push us to the ground
We stand tall, we make our sound

Babylon, Babylon, we see your game
Babylon, Babylon, we know your name
Babylon, Babylon, we won't be tamed
Babylon, Babylon, we break the chain
