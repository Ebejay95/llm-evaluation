In the wake of your demise
The echoes of your words still resonate
A hollow crown for the hollow man
A legacy of ashes and dust

Misery's crown, it weighs you down
A burden too heavy to bear
In the shadow of your throne
The whispers of deceit still linger

A kingdom built on lies
A fortress of despair
The walls are closing in
The end is drawing near

Misery's crown, it weighs you down
A burden too heavy to bear
In the shadow of your throne
The whispers of deceit still linger

The crown of misery, it slips away
As the truth begins to unfold
The king of lies, he falls from grace
And the empire crumbles to the ground

Misery's crown, it weighs you down
A burden too heavy to bear
In the shadow of your throne
The whispers of deceit still linger

The crown of misery, it slips away
As the truth begins to unfold
The king of lies, he falls from grace
And the empire crumbles to the ground
