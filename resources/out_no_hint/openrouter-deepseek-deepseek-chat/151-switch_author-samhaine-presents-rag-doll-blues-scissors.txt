SamHaiNe presents, Rag Doll Blues, Scissors  
Cutting through the fabric of my mind  
Threads unravel, pieces left behind  
A patchwork heart, stitched with pain and lies  
Rag doll blues, under tear-stained skies  

Scissors snip, the silence cuts so deep  
Memories fray, secrets I can't keep  
Tangled threads of love, now torn apart  
Rag doll blues, a broken work of art  

Patch me up, sew me tight  
Hide the scars, out of sight  
But the stitches never hold, they always fray  
Rag doll blues, I’m fading away  

Scissors gleam, in the dim-lit room  
Cutting ties, sealing my doom  
A puppet’s life, strings pulled too tight  
Rag doll blues, lost in the night  

Patch me up, sew me tight  
Hide the scars, out of sight  
But the stitches never hold, they always fray  
Rag doll blues, I’m fading away  

Scissors rest, the damage is done  
A rag doll’s tale, under a setting sun  
Threadbare soul, worn thin by time  
Rag doll blues, a sorrowful rhyme
