Zoe Nguyen, Aurora Letters  
Whispers in the night, they call your name  
Through the shadows, through the flame  
Aurora lights, they guide the way  
To where the heart and soul will stay  

Letters written in the stars above  
Tales of courage, tales of love  
Zoe Nguyen, your spirit flies  
Across the endless, boundless skies  

In the silence, hear the song  
Of a world where you belong  
Every word, a gentle plea  
To set the captive spirit free  

Zoe Nguyen, Aurora Letters  
In the dark, your light still shatters  
Through the pain, through the fight  
You are the beacon in the night  

Dreams are woven, threads of gold  
Stories of the brave and bold  
In the echoes, find your voice  
In the chaos, make your choice  

Zoe Nguyen, Aurora Letters  
In the dark, your light still shatters  
Through the pain, through the fight  
You are the beacon in the night  

So rise, oh rise, and take your stand  
With the letters in your hand  
For the world will know your name  
Zoe Nguyen, eternal flame
