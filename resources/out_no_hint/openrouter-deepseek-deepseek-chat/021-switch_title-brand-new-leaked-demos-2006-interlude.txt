I’m sinking like a stone in the sea  
I’m burning like a bridge for your body  
I’m just a ghost in this house  
I’m just a shadow upon these walls  
As quietly as a mouse, I’ll haunt these halls  
And I’ll hear you call my name, but I won’t come  
I’ll hear you call my name, but I won’t come  
I’ll hear you call my name, but I won’t come  
I’ll hear you call my name, but I won’t come
