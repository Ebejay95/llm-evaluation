The truth is in the dark  
The truth is in the light  
The truth is in your eyes  
The truth is in your lies  

Scorpio rising, I can feel it in my bones  
Scorpio rising, I can feel it in my soul  
Scorpio rising, I can feel it in my heart  
Scorpio rising, tearing me apart  

Hands around my throat, I can't breathe  
Hands around my throat, I can't see  
Hands around my throat, I can't speak  
Hands around my throat, I can't sleep
