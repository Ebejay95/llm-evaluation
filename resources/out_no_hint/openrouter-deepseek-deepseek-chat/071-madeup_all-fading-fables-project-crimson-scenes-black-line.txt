(Verse 1)  
In the shadows where the whispers grow,  
A tale unfolds, where the rivers flow.  
Crimson scenes paint the silent night,  
Black lines drawn in the pale moonlight.  

(Chorus)  
Fading fables, lost in time,  
Echoes of a broken rhyme.  
Crimson scars, a haunting dream,  
Black lines blur where truths convene.  

(Verse 2)  
Through the ashes of forgotten lore,  
We trace the paths we walked before.  
The ink runs dry, the pages tear,  
Yet the story lingers in the air.  

(Chorus)  
Fading fables, lost in time,  
Echoes of a broken rhyme.  
Crimson scars, a haunting dream,  
Black lines blur where truths convene.  

(Bridge)  
In the silence, we find our way,  
Through the darkness, we’ll seize the day.  
Though the fables fade, we’ll still believe,  
In the tales that our hearts conceive.  

(Chorus)  
Fading fables, lost in time,  
Echoes of a broken rhyme.  
Crimson scars, a haunting dream,  
Black lines blur where truths convene.  

(Outro)  
In the end, the stories remain,  
Through the joy, the loss, the pain.  
Fading fables, forever true,  
Crimson scenes, black lines anew.
