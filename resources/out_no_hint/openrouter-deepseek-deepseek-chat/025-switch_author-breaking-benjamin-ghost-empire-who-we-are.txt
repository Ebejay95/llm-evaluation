Who we are, who we are
Who we are, who we are
We are the shadows, we are the light
We are the reason, we are the fight
We are the broken, we are the torn
We are the ones who are yet to be born
Who we are, who we are
Who we are, who we are
We are the lost, we are the found
We are the silence, we are the sound
We are the fallen, we are the rise
We are the truth, we are the lies
Who we are, who we are
Who we are, who we are
We are the ghosts of the empire
We are the spark, we are the fire
We are the end, we are the start
We are the beat of the broken heart
Who we are, who we are
Who we are, who we are
