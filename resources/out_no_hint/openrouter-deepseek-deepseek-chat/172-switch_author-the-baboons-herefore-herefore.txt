Herefore, herefore, the baboons are calling  
Through the jungle, their voices are falling  
Herefore, herefore, the night is descending  
In the shadows, their whispers are blending  

Herefore, herefore, the moon is ascending  
In the silence, their chants are unending  
Herefore, herefore, the stars are aligning  
In the darkness, their spirits are shining  

Herefore, herefore, the baboons are dreaming  
In the twilight, their visions are streaming  
Herefore, herefore, the dawn is approaching  
In the light, their echoes are encroaching
