(Verse 1)  
I see the fire in your eyes,  
A burning light that never dies.  
Through the darkest of the nights,  
You stand tall, you stand and fight.  

(Chorus)  
Stick to your guns, hold on tight,  
The hope division’s by your side.  
Through the storm, through the pain,  
We will rise, we’ll break the chains.  

(Verse 2)  
No more fear, no more doubt,  
Let the white light lead you out.  
Every step, every fall,  
Only makes you stronger, standing tall.  

(Chorus)  
Stick to your guns, hold on tight,  
The hope division’s by your side.  
Through the storm, through the pain,  
We will rise, we’ll break the chains.  

(Bridge)  
No surrender, no retreat,  
This is where the warriors meet.  
With every heartbeat, with every breath,  
We defy the jaws of death.  

(Outro)  
Stick to your guns, the light won’t fade,  
The hope division’s here to stay.  
Through the fire, through the fight,  
We are the white light.
