Here are the lyrics to "Velvet Waves" by Candlebox:  

*[Verse 1]*  
I can see the velvet waves  
Crashing down on me  
I can feel the velvet waves  
Taking over me  

*[Chorus]*  
And I don't mind  
No, I don't mind  
And I don't mind  
No, I don't mind  

*[Verse 2]*  
I can hear the velvet sound  
Echoing in me  
I can taste the velvet sound  
Running through my veins  

*[Chorus]*  
And I don't mind  
No, I don't mind  
And I don't mind  
No, I don't mind  

*[Bridge]*  
Take me under  
Pull me down  
Let me drown  
In your velvet waves  

*[Chorus]*  
And I don't mind  
No, I don't mind  
And I don't mind  
No, I don't mind
