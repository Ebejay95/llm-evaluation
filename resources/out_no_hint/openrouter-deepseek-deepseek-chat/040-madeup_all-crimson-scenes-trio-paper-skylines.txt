Crimson skies bleed into the night,  
Paper skylines fold and ignite.  
Whispers of shadows dance in the air,  
Lost in the echoes of a silent prayer.  

Fragments of dreams scatter and fade,  
Ink-stained memories, a masquerade.  
The world spins slow, a fragile thread,  
Moments unravel, left unsaid.  

Beneath the surface, secrets reside,  
A labyrinth of truths we try to hide.  
The crimson trio, a haunting refrain,  
A symphony of loss, love, and pain.  

Paper skylines, they crumble and fall,  
Yet in the ruins, we hear the call.  
To rebuild, to rise, to find our way,  
Through the crimson scenes of yesterday.
