Endless nights, we’ve burned the flame  
Through the shadows, we’ve carved our name  
In the echoes of the songs we’ve sung  
In the silence, our hearts still young  

Lest we forget the fire we’ve lit  
The battles fought, the scars we’ve kept  
In the ashes, the memories stay  
Rock is dead, but we’ll never fade away  

Through the chaos, we found our sound  
In the madness, we stood our ground  
Every chord, every scream, every tear  
In the music, we’ve conquered fear  

Lest we forget the fire we’ve lit  
The battles fought, the scars we’ve kept  
In the ashes, the memories stay  
Rock is dead, but we’ll never fade away  

So here we stand, with the end in sight  
But the spirit lives, in the endless night  
Through the ages, our legacy remains  
In the heart of the storm, we’ll break the chains  

Lest we forget the fire we’ve lit  
The battles fought, the scars we’ve kept  
In the ashes, the memories stay  
Rock is dead, but we’ll never fade away
