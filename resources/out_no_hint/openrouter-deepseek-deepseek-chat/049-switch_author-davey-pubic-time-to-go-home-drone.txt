Davey Pubic, time to go home  
The night is fading, you’re all alone  
Drone in the sky, it hums so low  
Whispers of dawn, it’s time to go  

Davey Pubic, the streets are bare  
The echoes linger, but no one’s there  
Drone in the dark, it watches still  
Guiding you back, against your will  

Davey Pubic, the lights are dim  
The city sleeps, but you’re within  
Drone in the distance, it calls your name  
Leading you back, to where you came  

Davey Pubic, time to go home  
The night is fading, you’re all alone  
Drone in the sky, it hums so low  
Whispers of dawn, it’s time to go
