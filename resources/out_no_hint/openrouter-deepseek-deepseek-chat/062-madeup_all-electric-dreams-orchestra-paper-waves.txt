Paper waves, they carry me away
Drifting through the night, into the day
Whispers of the past, echoes in the haze
Paper waves, they guide me through the maze

Folding, unfolding, the stories they tell
In the silence, I hear them well
Paper waves, they rise and fall
In their rhythm, I lose it all

Dreams like paper, fragile and thin
Caught in the wind, they spin and spin
Paper waves, they take me far
To the edges of where we are

In the ocean of time, they float and sway
Paper waves, they lead the way
Through the shadows, through the light
Paper waves, they hold me tight

Folding, unfolding, the stories they tell
In the silence, I hear them well
Paper waves, they rise and fall
In their rhythm, I lose it all

Dreams like paper, fragile and thin
Caught in the wind, they spin and spin
Paper waves, they take me far
To the edges of where we are

Paper waves, they carry me home
Through the darkness, Iâ€™m not alone
Paper waves, they whisper and sing
In their melody, I find everything
