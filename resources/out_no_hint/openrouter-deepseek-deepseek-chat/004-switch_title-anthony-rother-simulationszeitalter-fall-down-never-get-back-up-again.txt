(Verse 1)  
Falling down, never get back up again  
Lost in time, where the circuits never end  
Digital dreams, they consume my mind  
In this simulation, I’m left behind  

(Chorus)  
Fall down, never get back up again  
The system’s cold, it’s pulling me in  
Fall down, never get back up again  
Reset my soul, let the code begin  

(Verse 2)  
Fragments of life in a pixelated haze  
Algorithms twist in an endless maze  
No escape from the neon glow  
In this machine world, I’m just a shadow  

(Chorus)  
Fall down, never get back up again  
The system’s cold, it’s pulling me in  
Fall down, never get back up again  
Reset my soul, let the code begin  

(Bridge)  
Binary whispers, they call my name  
Static voices, they sound the same  
No more feeling, just ones and zeros  
Trapped inside this cyber inferno  

(Chorus)  
Fall down, never get back up again  
The system’s cold, it’s pulling me in  
Fall down, never get back up again  
Reset my soul, let the code begin
