Plastic noise experience, sunnypsyop, memory flow  
Fragments of time, in a digital glow  
Echoes of dreams, where the shadows grow  
Lost in the static, the signals slow  

Waves of distortion, a fractured stream  
Flickers of light, in a data dream  
Patterns emerge, in the endless scheme  
A coded illusion, a virtual theme  

Sunnypsyop, the mindâ€™s deceit  
Plastic noise, where the senses meet  
Memory flow, in a looped repeat  
A synthetic world, incomplete  

Shadows collide, in a pixelated haze  
Reality bends, in a coded maze  
Fragments of thought, in a digital phase  
A fleeting moment, in a timeless space  

Plastic noise experience, sunnypsyop, memory flow  
In the endless stream, where the echoes go  
A fractured reality, in the digital show  
Lost in the static, where the shadows grow
