Let go, restless
I’m trying to find my way back home
Let go, restless
I’m trying to find my way back home

I’ve been lost in the static
I’ve been lost in the sound
I’ve been lost in the static
I’ve been lost in the sound

Let go, restless
I’m trying to find my way back home
Let go, restless
I’m trying to find my way back home

I’ve been lost in the static
I’ve been lost in the sound
I’ve been lost in the static
I’ve been lost in the sound

Let go, restless
I’m trying to find my way back home
Let go, restless
I’m trying to find my way back home

Let go, restless
I’m trying to find my way back home
Let go, restless
I’m trying to find my way back home
