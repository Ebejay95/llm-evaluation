Yota, lucid dreams, one by one  
Fading colors, chasing the sun  
In the silence, whispers call

In the stillness, time unwinds  
In the darkness, the truth we find  

Yota, lucid dreams, one by one  
Fading colors, chasing the sun  
In the silence, whispers call  
Through the shadows, I watch them fall  

Yota, lucid dreams, one by one  
Lost in echoes, where we begun  
In the stillness, time unwinds  
In the darkness, the truth we find
