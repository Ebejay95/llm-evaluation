Lights of waves, they dance on the shore,  
Whispering secrets, forevermore.  
Echoes of the ocean, in the night,  
Guiding lost souls with their gentle light.  

The tide it rises, the tide it falls,  
A timeless rhythm that forever calls.  
In the depths, where the shadows play,  
The lights of waves will show the way.  

Through the storm, through the calm,  
In the silence, a soothing balm.  
The horizon calls, the heart it saves,  
In the embrace of the lights of waves.  

Lights of waves, they shimmer and gleam,  
A fleeting moment, a timeless dream.  
In their glow, we find our place,  
Lost and found in the ocean's grace.  

Through the storm, through the calm,  
In the silence, a soothing balm.  
The horizon calls, the heart it saves,  
In the embrace of the lights of waves.  

Lights of waves, they guide us home,  
Through the darkness, weâ€™re not alone.  
In their glow, we find our way,  
Forever bound by the lights of waves.
