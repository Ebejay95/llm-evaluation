In the quiet of the dawn, where the shadows softly play,  
Whispers of the past drift in, like echoes of yesterday.  
The tales we spun, the dreams we chased, now etched in fading light,  
A canvas painted with the hues of stories lost in night.  

Through the mist, the figures rise, their voices faint but clear,  
Each a chapter, each a verse, a fable drawing near.  
The hero’s call, the villain’s fall, the laughter and the tears,  
A symphony of moments lived across the fleeting years.  

Oh, the scenes of fables, woven tight,  
In the loom of time, they take their flight.  
Every thread a memory, every stitch a rhyme,  
In the tapestry of life, they’ll forever shine.  

So let us wander through the tales, where truth and fiction blend,  
For in the heart of every fable, lies a message to transcend.  
The lessons learned, the bridges burned, the paths we’ve left behind,  
In the scenes of fables, our souls forever find.
