Here are the lyrics for "Calamari Safari" from *Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead* (Interlude):  

---  
*Squid, squid, calamari!  
Tentacles so wild and scary!  
Deep beneath the ocean blue,  
We’re coming after you!  

Squid, squid, calamari!  
Slippery and kinda hairy!  
Wrap you up and drag you down,  
To a watery grave you’ll drown!*
