(Verse 1)  
Whispers hum in neon veins,  
Flicker codes through hollow frames.  
Static hands reach through the glass,  
Pulling echoes from the past.  

(Chorus)  
Electric shadows paint the walls,  
Black light spills where silence falls.  
We are the ghosts in hollow sight,  
Dancing where the wires write.  

(Verse 2)  
Cold machines hum lullabies,  
Binary dreams in dead men’s eyes.  
Fractured screens rewrite the lies,  
A silent scream in pixelized disguise.  

(Chorus)  
Electric shadows paint the walls,  
Black light spills where silence falls.  
We are the ghosts in hollow sight,  
Dancing where the wires write.  

(Bridge)  
Trace the pulse beneath the skin,  
A phantom touch, a fading din.  
The signal breaks, the pattern bends,  
Lost again where the static ends.  

(Outro)  
Fade into the afterglow,  
A silent script we’ll never know.  
The shadows stretch, the black light dies,  
Nothing left but empty skies.
