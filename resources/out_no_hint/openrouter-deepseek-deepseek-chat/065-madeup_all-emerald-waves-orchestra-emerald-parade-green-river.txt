Emerald waves, they crash and flow,
Through the valleys where the green rivers go.
A parade of colors, a symphony of sound,
In the heart of nature, where peace is found.

Emerald waves, they dance and play,
Guiding the way through the emerald parade.
Green rivers whisper secrets untold,
In their depths, stories of old.

Emerald waves, they rise and fall,
Echoing the call of the wild and free.
Green rivers carry dreams afar,
Beneath the light of a guiding star.

Emerald waves, they shimmer and gleam,
In the moonlight's soft, enchanting beam.
Green rivers sing a lullaby,
As the night embraces the sky.

Emerald waves, they forever roam,
In the heart of the earth, they find their home.
Green rivers flow, a timeless stream,
In the emerald parade, a living dream.
