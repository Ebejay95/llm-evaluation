"Goodbye" by Slipknot:  
I wanna slit your throat and fuck the wound  
I wanna push my face in and feel the swoon  
I wanna dig inside, find a little bit of me  
'Cause the line gets crossed when you don't come clean  

My wormwood meets your pesticide  
You'll never get out 'cause you were never alive  
I am infinite, I am the infant finite  
Come a little closer and I'll show you why  

Nobody wants anything I've got  
Which is fine because you're made of everything I'm not  
The ashes of all that you've done  
The truth staring everyone in the face, you better run  

Goodbye  

"Goodbye" by Alannah Myles:  
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye  
I'm leaving you behind  
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye  
I'm leaving you behind  

I've been waiting for so long  
To find the strength to carry on  
And now I know it's time to go  
I've got to leave you behind  

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye  
I'm leaving you behind  
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye  
I'm leaving you behind
