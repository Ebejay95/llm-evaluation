Kai Rossi, Crimson Horizons, White Sky  
Echoes of a world that’s passing by  
Shadows dance where the light once played  
In the silence, our dreams decayed  

Crimson Horizons, bleeding through the night  
White Sky whispers, fading out of sight  
Kai Rossi, a name etched in the stars  
Guiding us through the scars  

We walk the path where the rivers bend  
Through the ashes, we’ll rise again  
Kai Rossi, Crimson Horizons, White Sky  
In the chaos, we’ll learn to fly  

Crimson Horizons, bleeding through the night  
White Sky whispers, fading out of sight  
Kai Rossi, a name etched in the stars  
Guiding us through the scars  

In the end, we’ll find our way  
Through the darkness, into the day  
Kai Rossi, Crimson Horizons, White Sky  
Forever bound, we’ll never die
