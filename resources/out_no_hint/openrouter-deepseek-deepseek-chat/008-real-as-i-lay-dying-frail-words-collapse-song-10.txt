As I lay dying, I hear the whispers of the past
Frail words collapse, they fade away so fast
The weight of silence, it crushes my soul
In this empty room, I’m losing control

The echoes of regret, they haunt my mind
A shattered heart, no peace to find
The shadows creep, they steal my breath
In this darkness, I face my death

As I lay dying, I see the faces I once knew
Frail words collapse, they vanish like the dew
The chains of sorrow, they bind me tight
In this endless night, I lose the fight

The memories burn, they scorch my skin
A battle lost, I can’t win
The void consumes, it pulls me in
In this abyss, I meet my end

As I lay dying, I feel the cold embrace
Frail words collapse, they leave no trace
The final breath, it slips away
In this moment, I find my stay

The silence falls, it’s deafening
A life extinguished, no more suffering
The light fades, it’s gone for good
In this stillness, I’m understood

As I lay dying, I’m finally free
Frail words collapse, they mean nothing to me
The end is here, it’s time to go
In this peace, I let it flow
