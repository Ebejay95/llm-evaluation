Through the neon windows, we see the world in shades of blue  
Hollow windows whisper tales of what we thought we knew  
Red River flows, it carries all the secrets we can't hold  
In the silence, we find the stories left untold  

Echoes in the night, they call us back to where we began  
Through the neon windows, we try to understand  
Hollow windows frame the lives we left behind  
Red River sings, it knows the truth we try to hide  

In the glow of the city, we search for something real  
Through the neon windows, we learn to feel  
Hollow windows hold the dreams we let decay  
Red River guides us, it shows us the way  

Through the neon windows, we see the world anew  
Hollow windows fade, the Red River pulls us through  
In the end, we find the light we always knew  
Through the neon windows, the Red River leads us true
