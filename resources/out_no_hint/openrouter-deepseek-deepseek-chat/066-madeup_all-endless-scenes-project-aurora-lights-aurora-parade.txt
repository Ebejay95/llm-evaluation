Endless scenes unfold before my eyes  
Aurora lights paint colors in the skies  
A parade of dreams, they dance and they glide  
Through the night, where the stars collide  

Whispers of the wind, they sing their song  
Guiding me where I belong  
In this moment, time stands still  
Aurora's magic, a world to fill  

Endless scenes, they call my name  
Aurora lights, a burning flame  
Through the dark, they lead the way  
Aurora parade, night turns to day  

Silent echoes, they softly speak  
Of wonders vast, of peaks so steep  
In the heart of the northern glow  
A story unfolds, a tale to know  

Endless scenes, they call my name  
Aurora lights, a burning flame  
Through the dark, they lead the way  
Aurora parade, night turns to day  

In the silence, I find my peace  
Aurora's beauty will never cease  
Endless scenes, forever near  
Aurora lights, forever clear
