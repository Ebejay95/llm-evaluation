Lost in the haze of a wandering sky,
Echoes of dreams where the shadows lie.
Whispers of light in the electric air,
Fragments of sound, a symphony rare.

Drifting through time, a celestial stream,
Visions unfold in a luminous dream.
Horizons expand, the cosmos align,
Infinite paths in the vast design.

Silent vibrations, a cosmic refrain,
Resonant echoes that linger and remain.
Through the expanse, the journey unfolds,
A tapestry woven in stories untold.

Wandering skylines, a prelude to flight,
Boundless horizons in the depths of night.
Electric fragments, a dance in the void,
Infinite moments, forever employed.
