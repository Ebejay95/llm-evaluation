[Verse 1]  
I’ve been waiting for you  
I’ve been waiting for you  
I’ve been waiting for you  
I’ve been waiting for you  

[Verse 2]  
I’ve been waiting for you  
I’ve been waiting for you  
I’ve been waiting for you  
I’ve been waiting for you  

[Chorus]  
Burial ground, burial ground  
I’ve been waiting for you  
Burial ground, burial ground  
I’ve been waiting for you  

[Verse 3]  
I’ve been waiting for you  
I’ve been waiting for you  
I’ve been waiting for you  
I’ve been waiting for you  

[Chorus]  
Burial ground, burial ground  
I’ve been waiting for you  
Burial ground, burial ground  
I’ve been waiting for you  

[Outro]  
I’ve been waiting for you  
I’ve been waiting for you  
I’ve been waiting for you  
I’ve been waiting for you
