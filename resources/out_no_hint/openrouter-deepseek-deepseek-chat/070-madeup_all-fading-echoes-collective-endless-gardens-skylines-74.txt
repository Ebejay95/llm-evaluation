Fading echoes call my name, through the endless gardens we roam,  
Skylines stretch, a canvas wide, where dreams and shadows are sown.  
Whispers of the past collide, with futures yet to be known,  
In the silence, we abide, where the seeds of hope are grown.  

Through the mist, the colors blend, a tapestry of time and space,  
Every step, a journey’s end, yet a new path to embrace.  
In the stillness, hearts will mend, as we find our resting place,  
Fading echoes, they transcend, leaving traces we can’t erase.  

Endless gardens, ever green, where the light and darkness meet,  
Skylines rise, a world unseen, where the earth and heavens greet.  
In the echoes, we convene, with the rhythm of our heartbeat,  
Fading whispers, soft and serene, guide us home, where all is complete.
