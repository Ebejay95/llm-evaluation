"Stray From The Path, Jerks Rule!!, Crazy"  
I’m not here to play nice, I’m here to disrupt  
Your system’s a joke, your power corrupt  
We’re the voice of the voiceless, the scream in the silence  
Your empire’s crumbling, we’re the new defiance  

Jerks rule, we’re breaking the mold  
No more chains, no more control  
Crazy? Maybe, but we’re wide awake  
Your lies won’t hold, your walls will break  

We’re the outcasts, the rebels, the ones you can’t tame  
Your rules are a cage, we’re setting it aflame  
Stray from the path, we’re carving our own  
Your world’s a facade, we’re tearing it down  

Jerks rule, we’re breaking the mold  
No more chains, no more control  
Crazy? Maybe, but we’re wide awake  
Your lies won’t hold, your walls will break  

This is our anthem, our battle cry  
We’re the storm in the calm, the fire in the sky  
No surrender, no retreat  
We’re the ones you’ll never defeat  

Jerks rule, we’re breaking the mold  
No more chains, no more control  
Crazy? Maybe, but we’re wide awake  
Your lies won’t hold, your walls will break  

Stray from the path, we’re the new regime  
Your old world’s over, this is our dream  
Jerks rule, we’re breaking the mold  
Crazy? Maybe, but we’re bold and cold.
