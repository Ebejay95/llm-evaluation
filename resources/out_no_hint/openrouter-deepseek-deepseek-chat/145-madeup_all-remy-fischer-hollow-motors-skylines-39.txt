(Verse 1)  
Remy Fischer’s got a heart like a hollow motor,  
Spinning fast but it’s running on fumes.  
Skylines blur in the rearview mirror,  
Chasing dreams that keep slipping through the cracks in the room.  

(Chorus)  
Oh, the city lights flicker like a broken neon sign,  
Remy’s driving through the night, trying to leave it all behind.  
Hollow motors hum, but the silence cuts so deep,  
Skylines fade, and the secrets that we keep.  

(Verse 2)  
He’s got a map with no destination,  
Just a compass pointing to nowhere at all.  
The engine roars, but it’s just a vibration,  
Echoes of a life that’s starting to stall.  

(Chorus)  
Oh, the city lights flicker like a broken neon sign,  
Remy’s driving through the night, trying to leave it all behind.  
Hollow motors hum, but the silence cuts so deep,  
Skylines fade, and the secrets that we keep.  

(Bridge)  
The road is long, but the miles feel short,  
Every turn leads back to where he started.  
The weight of the world in a hollow motor’s port,  
Remy’s heart is heavy, but it’s still beating, still beating.  

(Chorus)  
Oh, the city lights flicker like a broken neon sign,  
Remy’s driving through the night, trying to leave it all behind.  
Hollow motors hum, but the silence cuts so deep,  
Skylines fade, and the secrets that we keep.  

(Outro)  
Remy Fischer’s got a heart like a hollow motor,  
Spinning fast but it’s running on fumes.  
Skylines blur in the rearview mirror,  
Chasing dreams that keep slipping through the cracks in the room.
