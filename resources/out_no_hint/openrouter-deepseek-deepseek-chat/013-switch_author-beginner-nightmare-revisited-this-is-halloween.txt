When the crypt doors creak and the tombstones quake  
Spooks come out for a swinging wake  
Happy haunts materialize  
And begin to vocalize  
Grim grinning ghosts come out to socialize  

Now, before the sun rises, let's get this straight  
It's all about the shadows, the dark, and the fate  
This is Halloween, this is Halloween  
Pumpkins scream in the dead of night  

This is Halloween, everybody make a scene  
Trick or treat till the neighbors gonna die of fright  
It's our town, everybody scream  
In this town of Halloween  

I am the shadow on the moon at night  
Filling your dreams to the brim with fright  
This is Halloween, this is Halloween  
Halloween! Halloween! Halloween! Halloween!  

In this town, we call home  
Everyone hail to the pumpkin song  
In this town, don't we love it now?  
Everybody's waiting for the next surprise  

Round that corner, man, hiding in the trash can  
Something's waiting now to pounce and how it'll flash  
It's a clown with a tear-away face  
There's an unexpected item in the bagging area  

Skeleton Jack might catch you in the back  
And scream like a banshee  
Make you jump out of your skin  
This is Halloween, everybody scream  
Won't you please make way for a very special guy  

Our man Jack is king of the pumpkin patch  
Everyone hail to the Pumpkin King now  
This is Halloween, this is Halloween  
Halloween! Halloween! Halloween! Halloween!  

In this town, we call home  
Everyone hail to the pumpkin song  
La la-la la, la la-la la, la la-la la, la la-la la  
La la-la la, la la-la la, la la-la la, la la-la la  

Boys and girls of every age  
Wouldn't you like to see something strange?  
Come with us and you will see  
This, our town of Halloween  

This is Halloween, this is Halloween  
Pumpkins scream in the dead of night  
This is Halloween, everybody make a scene  
Trick or treat till the neighbors gonna die of fright  

It's our town, everybody scream  
In this town of Halloween  
I am the one hiding under your bed  
Teeth ground sharp and eyes glowing red  

I am the one hiding under your stairs  
Fingers like snakes and spiders in my hair  
This is Halloween, this is Halloween  
Halloween! Halloween! Halloween! Halloween!  

In this town, we call home  
Everyone hail to the pumpkin song  
This is Halloween, this is Halloween  
Halloween! Halloween! Halloween! Halloween!  

In this town, we call home  
Everyone hail to the pumpkin song  
La la-la la, la la-la la, la la-la la, la la-la la  
La la-la la, la la-la la, la la-la la, la la-la la
