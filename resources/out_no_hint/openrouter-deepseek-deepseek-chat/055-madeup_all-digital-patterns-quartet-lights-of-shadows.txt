Lights of shadows, dancing in the night,  
Whispers of the stars, guiding our flight.  
Echoes of the past, futures untold,  
In the digital patterns, our stories unfold.  

Shapes of silence, colors of sound,  
In the rhythm of chaos, we are found.  
Moments of stillness, movements of time,  
In the lights of shadows, we align.  

Fragments of dreams, scattered and free,  
In the endless void, we find our key.  
Through the maze of thoughts, we navigate,  
In the lights of shadows, we create.  

Lights of shadows, blending as one,  
In the dance of existence, we are undone.  
In the digital patterns, we see the way,  
In the lights of shadows, we stay.
