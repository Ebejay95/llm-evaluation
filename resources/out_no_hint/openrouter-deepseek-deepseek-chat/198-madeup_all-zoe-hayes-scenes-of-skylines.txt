Zoe Hayes, Scenes of Skylines  
Walking through the city lights,  
Shadows dance, the night ignites.  
Echoes of a distant call,  
Whispers rise, they start to fall.  

Scenes of skylines, painted dreams,  
Fragments of what life could mean.  
In the silence, hearts collide,  
Lost in moments, side by side.  

Footsteps fade, the world stands still,  
Time unravels, bends its will.  
Every corner holds a tale,  
Every star begins to pale.  

Scenes of skylines, painted dreams,  
Fragments of what life could mean.  
In the silence, hearts collide,  
Lost in moments, side by side.  

Through the haze, the dawn will break,  
New horizons, paths to take.  
In the chaos, weâ€™ll find our way,  
Guided by the light of day.  

Scenes of skylines, painted dreams,  
Fragments of what life could mean.  
In the silence, hearts collide,  
Lost in moments, side by side.
