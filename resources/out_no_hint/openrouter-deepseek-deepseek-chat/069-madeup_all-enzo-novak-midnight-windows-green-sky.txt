Midnight windows, shadows dance,  
Green sky whispers, lost in trance.  
Echoes of the night, they call my name,  
In the silence, nothing's the same.  

Footsteps fade, the city sleeps,  
Dreams awaken, secrets keep.  
Through the haze, I see your face,  
A fleeting moment, time can't erase.  

Midnight windows, green sky above,  
A canvas painted with shades of love.  
In the stillness, we find our way,  
Guided by the light of the fading day.  

Stars align, the world stands still,  
Hearts collide, against our will.  
In the darkness, we find our spark,  
A flame that glows in the endless dark.  

Midnight windows, green sky above,  
A canvas painted with shades of love.  
In the stillness, we find our way,  
Guided by the light of the fading day.  

As the night fades into dawn,  
We hold on to what we've drawn.  
Midnight windows, green sky's embrace,  
A fleeting moment, time can't replace.
