(Verse 1)  
Shadows whisper through the trees,  
Echoes of forgotten dreams.  
A canvas painted in twilight hues,  
Where every stroke tells a tale we lose.  

(Chorus)  
Fading scenes, they drift away,  
Like whispers lost in the light of day.  
Scenes of fables, etched in time,  
A red line drawn, a paradigm.  

(Verse 2)  
Footsteps fade on the cobblestone,  
A story told, yet left unknown.  
The clock ticks on, the pages turn,  
In the ashes, the embers burn.  

(Chorus)  
Fading scenes, they drift away,  
Like whispers lost in the light of day.  
Scenes of fables, etched in time,  
A red line drawn, a paradigm.  

(Bridge)  
Through the mist, the figures blur,  
A symphony of voices stir.  
The past and future intertwine,  
Beneath the stars, the red line shines.  

(Chorus)  
Fading scenes, they drift away,  
Like whispers lost in the light of day.  
Scenes of fables, etched in time,  
A red line drawn, a paradigm.  

(Outro)  
And as the night embraces dawn,  
The red line fades, but lingers on.  
In the silence, the stories remain,  
Fading scenes, eternal refrain.
