(Verse 1)  
In the white room, shadows creep,  
Whispers echo, secrets keep.  
Faces blurred, the lines are thin,  
Lost in the chaos, where do I begin?  

(Chorus)  
In the white room, we’re all the same,  
Masks we wear, no one to blame.  
Dirty rejects, we rise and fall,  
In the white room, we lose it all.  

(Verse 2)  
Zombie Boy walks through the haze,  
Eyes like fire, a haunting gaze.  
Broken dreams, they pave the way,  
In the white room, we’re led astray.  

(Chorus)  
In the white room, we’re all the same,  
Masks we wear, no one to blame.  
Dirty rejects, we rise and fall,  
In the white room, we lose it all.  

(Bridge)  
No escape, the walls close in,  
Silent screams, where do we begin?  
In the white room, we’re stripped bare,  
No illusions, no one to care.  

(Chorus)  
In the white room, we’re all the same,  
Masks we wear, no one to blame.  
Dirty rejects, we rise and fall,  
In the white room, we lose it all.  

(Outro)  
In the white room, the end is near,  
Fading echoes, nothing’s clear.  
Dirty rejects, we stand tall,  
In the white room, we lose it all.
