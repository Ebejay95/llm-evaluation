The lyrics to "Voices Off Camera" by Rise Against are:

We are the voices off camera
The whispers in the halls
We are the ones you’ll never see
But we’re the ones who built these walls

We are the hands that built the cities
The backs that carried the weight
We are the ones who keep the world turning
While you sit and debate

We are the voices off camera
The whispers in the halls
We are the ones you’ll never see
But we’re the ones who built these walls

We are the hands that built the cities
The backs that carried the weight
We are the ones who keep the world turning
While you sit and debate

We are the voices off camera
The whispers in the halls
We are the ones you’ll never see
But we’re the ones who built these walls

We are the hands that built the cities
The backs that carried the weight
We are the ones who keep the world turning
While you sit and debate

We are the voices off camera
The whispers in the halls
We are the ones you’ll never see
But we’re the ones who built these walls

We are the hands that built the cities
The backs that carried the weight
We are the ones who keep the world turning
While you sit and debate
