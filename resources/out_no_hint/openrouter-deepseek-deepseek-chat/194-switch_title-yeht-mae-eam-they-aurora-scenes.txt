Yeht mae, eam they, aurora scenes,  
Whispers of the night, where the silence leans.  
Stars above, they dance in the sky,  
A fleeting moment, as time drifts by.  

Yeht mae, eam they, aurora's glow,  
A canvas of colors, in the night's soft flow.  
Dreams awaken, in the light's embrace,  
A journey through the stars, in endless space.  

Yeht mae, eam they, aurora's call,  
A symphony of light, that enchants us all.  
In the heart of the night, where the magic streams,  
Yeht mae, eam they, aurora scenes.
