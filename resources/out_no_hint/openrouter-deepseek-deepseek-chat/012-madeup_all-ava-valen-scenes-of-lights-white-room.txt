In the white room, where the shadows fall
Scenes of light, they dance upon the wall
Ava Valen, whispers in the air
Echoes of a dream, beyond compare

In the silence, hear the heart's refrain
Moments captured, like a soft refrain
Through the darkness, see the colors bloom
In the white room, where the light consumes

Ava Valen, guide me through the night
Scenes of light, they lead me to the light
In the white room, where the shadows play
Find the truth, in the light of day
