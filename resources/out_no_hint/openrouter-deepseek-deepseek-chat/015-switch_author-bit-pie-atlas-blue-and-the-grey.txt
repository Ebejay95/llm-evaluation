Bit Pie, Atlas, Blue and the Grey,
Wandering through the night and day.
Shadows fall, the colors fade,
In the silence, we’re remade.

Bit Pie, Atlas, Blue and the Grey,
Lost in the echoes of yesterday.
Whispers call, the stars will stay,
Guiding us along the way.

Through the storm, we find our way,
Bit Pie, Atlas, Blue and the Grey.
In the heart of the endless fray,
We’ll keep moving, come what may.
