Here are the lyrics for the songs you mentioned:

**Mint Royale - "Blue Song"**
```
Blue song, blue song
Blue song, blue song
Blue song, blue song
Blue song, blue song
```

**Nightwish - "Dark Passion Play"**
```
The poet and the pendulum
The siren of the seas
The harpist and the minstrel boy
The beauty and the beast
```

**Nightwish - "The Poet And The Pendulum"**
```
Here at the edge of this world
Here I gaze at a pantheon of oak, a citadel of stone
I have no voice in this choir
I have no home in this empire of the hopeless
```
