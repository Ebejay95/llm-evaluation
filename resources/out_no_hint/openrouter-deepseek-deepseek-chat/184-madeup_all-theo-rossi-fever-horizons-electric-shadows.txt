Electric shadows dance on the wall,  
Fever horizons, they call.  
Theo Rossi whispers in the night,  
A symphony of dreams takes flight.  

Echoes of a world unseen,  
Colors bleed where we’ve been.  
Lost in the pulse of the neon glow,  
The rhythm of the unknown starts to flow.  

Electric shadows, they twist and turn,  
In the fire of the night, we burn.  
Fever horizons, they pull us in,  
A journey where the soul begins.  

Theo Rossi’s voice, a guiding light,  
Through the darkness, we take flight.  
Electric shadows, fever dreams,  
In the silence, nothing’s as it seems.  

The night unfolds, a canvas wide,  
In the electric shadows, we confide.  
Fever horizons, they call our name,  
In the heart of the fire, we’re never the same.
