"Letters Home" by Defeater, "No Relief":

I wrote you a letter, I hope it finds you well.  
I’m stuck in this trench, it’s a living hell.  
The bullets fly, the bombs explode,  
I’m just a boy, but I’m growing old.  

I think of home, I think of you,  
The life we had, the love we knew.  
But now I’m here, in this godforsaken place,  
With death and fear staring me in the face.  

No relief, no peace, no end in sight,  
Just the sound of gunfire in the dead of night.  
I close my eyes, I see your face,  
But I’m lost in this war, in this endless race.  

I wrote you a letter, I hope it finds you well.  
I’m stuck in this trench, it’s a living hell.  
I’ll keep on fighting, I’ll keep on strong,  
But I don’t know if I’ll make it home.  

No relief, no peace, no end in sight,  
Just the sound of gunfire in the dead of night.  
I close my eyes, I see your face,  
But I’m lost in this war, in this endless race.  

I wrote you a letter, I hope it finds you well.  
I’m stuck in this trench, it’s a living hell.  
I’ll keep on fighting, I’ll keep on strong,  
But I don’t know if I’ll make it home.
