I am the night, crimson shadows
Blackened skies, eternal sorrow
I am the night, crimson shadows
Darkened souls, no tomorrow

Through the mist, I see the light
But it fades into the night
Whispers call, I heed their cry
In the shadows, I will lie

I am the night, crimson shadows
Blackened skies, eternal sorrow
I am the night, crimson shadows
Darkened souls, no tomorrow

In the depths, where darkness reigns
I find solace in the pain
Echoes of a distant past
In the shadows, I am cast

I am the night, crimson shadows
Blackened skies, eternal sorrow
I am the night, crimson shadows
Darkened souls, no tomorrow

No escape, no retreat
In the night, I am complete
Crimson shadows, they embrace
In the darkness, I find my place

I am the night, crimson shadows
Blackened skies, eternal sorrow
I am the night, crimson shadows
Darkened souls, no tomorrow
