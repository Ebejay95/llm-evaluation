Brother Ali - "The Undisputed Truth":
"I’m the undisputed truth, the voice of the youth
The truth is the truth, even if nobody believes it
Lies are lies, even if everybody believes it
I’m the undisputed truth, the voice of the youth
The truth is the truth, even if nobody believes it
Lies are lies, even if everybody believes it"

Alice in Chains - "Man in the Box":
"I’m the man in the box
Buried in my shit
Won’t you come and save me?
Save me
Feed my eyes, can you sew them shut?
Jesus Christ, deny your maker
He who tries, will be wasted
Feed my eyes, now you’ve sewn them shut"
