[Verse 1]
I'm not like you, I can't hide behind a smile
I wear my heart right on my sleeve
I break so easy, I'm fragile, fragile

[Chorus]
Maybe memories are all I have
Maybe memories are all I have left
Maybe memories are all I have
Maybe memories are all I have left

[Verse 2]
I'm not like you, I can't fake it through the day
I wear my pain right on my sleeve
I break so easy, I'm fragile, fragile

[Chorus]
Maybe memories are all I have
Maybe memories are all I have left
Maybe memories are all I have
Maybe memories are all I have left

[Bridge]
I'm not like you, I'm not like you
I'm not like you, I'm not like you

[Outro]
Maybe memories are all I have
Maybe memories are all I have left
Maybe memories are all I have
Maybe memories are all I have left
