(Verse 1)
Lost in the echoes of my own mind,
Shadows creeping, leaving me blind.
Every whisper turns to a scream,
Drowning in this fractured dream.

(Chorus)
This is the breakdown of sanity,
A war inside, no guarantee.
Perception shattered, can't be free,
Deliverance is out of reach.

(Verse 2)
Mirrors reflect what I can't see,
A stranger staring back at me.
Pulling under, waves so deep,
Silence is the sound I keep.

(Chorus)
This is the breakdown of sanity,
A war inside, no guarantee.
Perception shattered, can't be free,
Deliverance is out of reach.

(Bridge)
I scream but no one hears,
Trapped inside my deepest fears.
The walls are closing in,
Is this where it all begins?

(Outro)
Break me down, tear me apart,
No light left, just the dark.
Perception fades, I can't pretend,
Deliverance won't be my end.
