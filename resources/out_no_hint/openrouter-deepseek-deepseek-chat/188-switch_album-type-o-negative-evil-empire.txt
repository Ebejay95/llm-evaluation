(Verse 1)  
The evil empire's got a hold on me  
With promises of wealth and prosperity  
But all I see is misery  
And all I feel is pain  

(Chorus)  
Evil empire, won't you set me free?  
From all this greed and hypocrisy  
Evil empire, can't you see?  
You're killing me  

(Verse 2)  
They feed us lies through the TV screen  
While they're living like kings and queens  
And we're just pawns in their wicked schemes  
Trapped in their game  

(Chorus)  
Evil empire, won't you set me free?  
From all this greed and hypocrisy  
Evil empire, can't you see?  
You're killing me  

(Bridge)  
No more chains, no more lies  
I won't be part of your demise  
I'll break away, I'll open my eyes  
And leave this evil empire behind  

(Outro)  
Evil empire, your time will come  
When all your deeds will be undone  
And we'll be free, we'll overcome  
The evil empire
