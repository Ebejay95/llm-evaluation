Here are the lyrics to "The Last Sunset" by Breakdown of Sanity:

---

The last sunset, the final breath
A fading light, a silent death
The world we knew, it slips away
In shadows deep, we lose our way

The echoes of our past remain
A haunting song, a ghostly chain
The dreams we had, they turn to dust
In this decay, we place our trust

The last sunset, the final call
As darkness falls, we lose it all
The stars will fade, the night will end
In silence, we will meet our end

The last sunset, the final fight
Against the void, we stand and fight
But in the end, we’ll fade to black
No turning back, no turning back

The last sunset, the final stand
We grasp for hope, but lose our hand
The world we knew, it slips away
In shadows deep, we lose our way

The last sunset, the final breath
A fading light, a silent death
The stars will fade, the night will end
In silence, we will meet our end

The last sunset, the final call
As darkness falls, we lose it all
The stars will fade, the night will end
In silence, we will meet our end

The last sunset, the final fight
Against the void, we stand and fight
But in the end, we’ll fade to black
No turning back, no turning back

The last sunset, the final stand
We grasp for hope, but lose our hand
The world we knew, it slips away
In shadows deep, we lose our way

The last sunset, the final breath
A fading light, a silent death
The stars will fade, the night will end
In silence, we will meet our end

The last sunset, the final call
As darkness falls, we lose it all
The stars will fade, the night will end
In silence, we will meet our end

The last sunset, the final fight
Against the void, we stand and fight
But in the end, we’ll fade to black
No turning back, no turning back

The last sunset, the final stand
We grasp for hope, but lose our hand
The world we knew, it slips away
In shadows deep, we lose our way

The last sunset, the final breath
A fading light, a silent death
The stars will fade, the night will end
In silence, we will meet our end

The last sunset, the final call
As darkness falls, we lose it all
The stars will fade, the night will end
In silence, we will meet our end

The last sunset, the final fight
Against the void, we stand and fight
But in the end, we’ll fade to black
No turning back, no turning back

The last sunset, the final stand
We grasp for hope, but lose our hand
The world we knew, it slips away
In shadows deep, we lose our way

The last sunset, the final breath
A fading light, a silent death
The stars will fade, the night will end
In silence, we will meet our end

The last sunset, the final call
As darkness falls, we lose it all
The stars will fade, the night will end
In silence, we will meet our end

The last sunset, the final fight
Against the void, we stand and fight
But in the end, we’ll fade to black
No turning back, no turning back

The last sunset, the final stand
We grasp for hope, but lose our hand
The world we knew, it slips away
In shadows deep, we lose our way

The last sunset, the final breath
A fading light, a silent death
The stars will fade, the night will end
In silence, we will meet our end

The last sunset, the final call
As darkness falls, we lose it all
The stars will fade, the night will end
In silence, we will meet our end

The last sunset, the final fight
Against the void, we stand and fight
But in the end, we’ll fade to black
No turning back, no turning back

The last sunset, the final stand
We grasp for hope, but lose our hand
The world we knew, it slips away
In shadows deep, we lose our way

The last sunset, the final breath
A fading light, a silent death
The stars will fade, the night will end
In silence, we will meet our end

The last sunset, the final call
As darkness falls, we lose it all
The stars will fade, the night will end
In silence, we will meet our end

The last sunset, the final fight
Against the void, we stand and fight
But in the end, we’ll fade to black
No turning back, no turning back
