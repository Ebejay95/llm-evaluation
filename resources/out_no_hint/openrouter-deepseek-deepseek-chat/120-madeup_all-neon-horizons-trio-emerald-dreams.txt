Emerald dreams, they call my name,
Through the mist, a flickering flame.
Neon lights, they paint the sky,
In colors bright, we learn to fly.

Whispers of the night, they guide our way,
Through the shadows, we find our play.
Emerald dreams, they hold the key,
To worlds unseen, where we are free.

Dancing stars, they light our path,
In the silence, we hear the laugh.
Of futures bright, and hopes anew,
Emerald dreams, they pull us through.

In the glow of the neon haze,
We find our place, in endless days.
Emerald dreams, they never fade,
In their embrace, our fears are laid.

So we wander, through the night,
In the glow of the city's light.
Emerald dreams, they guide our soul,
In their arms, we are whole.
