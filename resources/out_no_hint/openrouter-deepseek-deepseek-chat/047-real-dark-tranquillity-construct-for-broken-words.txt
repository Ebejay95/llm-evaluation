In the silence of the night, I hear the whispers of the past
Echoes of a life once lived, now fading fast
Broken words, they linger on, a shadow in my mind
A testament to what was lost, what I can't leave behind

Through the haze of time, I see the fragments of my soul
Pieces of a puzzle, never to be whole
The weight of every word, a burden I must bear
A constant reminder of the pain that lingers there

For broken words, I search for meaning in the void
A voice that once was strong, now muted and destroyed
In the depths of despair, I find a glimmer of light
A spark of hope that guides me through the endless night

The scars of yesterday, they mark the path I tread
A journey through the darkness, where fear and doubt are fed
But in the heart of chaos, I find the strength to fight
To rise above the ashes, and reclaim what's right

For broken words, I search for meaning in the void
A voice that once was strong, now muted and destroyed
In the depths of despair, I find a glimmer of light
A spark of hope that guides me through the endless night

Through the storm, I'll find my way, through the pain, I'll endure
For every broken word, a promise to be pure
In the silence of the night, I'll find my voice again
And from the ashes, I'll rise, to begin anew, to transcend

For broken words, I search for meaning in the void
A voice that once was strong, now muted and destroyed
In the depths of despair, I find a glimmer of light
A spark of hope that guides me through the endless night
