When will we surrender?  
The weight is breaking our backs.  
We’ve been holding on for so long,  
but the cracks are starting to show.  

Willows bend, they don’t break,  
but we’re not trees, we’re not stones.  
We’re flesh and bone,  
we’re flesh and bone.  

When will we surrender?  
The tide is pulling us in.  
We’ve been fighting for so long,  
but the waves are wearing us thin.  

Willows bend, they don’t break,  
but we’re not trees, we’re not stones.  
We’re flesh and bone,  
we’re flesh and bone.  

When will we surrender?  
When will we let go?  
When will we surrender?  
When will we let go?  

Willows bend, they don’t break,  
but we’re not trees, we’re not stones.  
We’re flesh and bone,  
we’re flesh and bone.
