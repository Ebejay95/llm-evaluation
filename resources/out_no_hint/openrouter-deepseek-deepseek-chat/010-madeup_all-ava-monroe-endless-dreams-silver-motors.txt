Ava Monroe, endless dreams, silver motors  
Chasing the horizon, where the sky ignites  
Whispers of the night, calling out my name  
In the silence, I find my way  

Ava Monroe, endless dreams, silver motors  
Through the shadows, where the stars collide  
Echoes of the past, guiding me tonight  
In the darkness, I’ll take my flight  

Ava Monroe, endless dreams, silver motors  
The road unwinds, a path unknown  
With every turn, I’m not alone  
Ava Monroe, endless dreams, silver motors  
Forever chasing, forever free  
In this endless dream, I’ll always be
