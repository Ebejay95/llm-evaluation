Testify, my boy, don't go back  
To the shadows where the light is cracked  
You’ve been running, but you’re almost there  
Don’t let the darkness pull you under, don’t you dare  

Testify, my boy, don’t you hide  
From the truth that’s burning deep inside  
You’ve got the strength to break the chain  
Don’t let the past define you, don’t let it remain  

Testify, my boy, don’t go back  
To the silence where the voices lack  
You’ve got a story, let it be heard  
Don’t let the world drown out your word  

Testify, my boy, don’t you fear  
The road ahead is long, but it’s clear  
You’ve got the fire, let it ignite  
Don’t let the night steal your fight  

Testify, my boy, don’t go back  
To the shadows where the light is cracked  
You’ve been running, but you’re almost there  
Don’t let the darkness pull you under, don’t you dare
