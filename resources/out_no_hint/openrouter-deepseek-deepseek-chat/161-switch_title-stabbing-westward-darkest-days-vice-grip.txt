Hold me down, I can't break free
This vice grip's killing me
I can't escape, I can't breathe
This vice grip's killing me

I'm trapped inside, I can't get out
This vice grip's killing me
I'm suffocating, I can't shout
This vice grip's killing me

I'm losing hope, I'm losing sight
This vice grip's killing me
I'm drowning in the endless night
This vice grip's killing me

Release me now, I need to breathe
This vice grip's killing me
I'm begging you, just set me free
This vice grip's killing me
