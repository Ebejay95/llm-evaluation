Huddle of Crudd, I glued my balls to my butthole again,  
I glued my balls to my butthole again,  
Stuck in a mess, no way to pretend,  
I glued my balls to my butthole again.  

Pain in the rear, a lesson to learn,  
Next time I’ll think before I return,  
To the glue and the chaos, the sticky dismay,  
I glued my balls to my butthole again.  

Huddle of Crudd, what have I done?  
This sticky situation’s no fun,  
But here I stand, in this sticky bind,  
I glued my balls to my butthole again.
