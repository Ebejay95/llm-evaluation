Here are the lyrics to "Thing About Me" by Calvin Scott:

[Verse 1]  
You say you love me, but I don’t know  
You say you need me, but you won’t show  
All of these words, they don’t mean a thing  
If you ain’t ready to give me everything  

[Chorus]  
There’s a thing about me, I need you to see  
I ain’t playing games, I need honesty  
If you can’t give me all that I need  
Then maybe you should just let me be  

[Verse 2]  
You keep me waiting, playing it cool  
But I ain’t got time to be nobody’s fool  
Actions speak louder than words can say  
So show me love or just walk away  

[Chorus]  
There’s a thing about me, I need you to see  
I ain’t playing games, I need honesty  
If you can’t give me all that I need  
Then maybe you should just let me be  

[Bridge]  
No more secrets, no more lies  
I can see it in your eyes  
Either love me right or set me free  
That’s the thing about me  

[Chorus]  
There’s a thing about me, I need you to see  
I ain’t playing games, I need honesty  
If you can’t give me all that I need  
Then maybe you should just let me be  

[Outro]  
Let me be, let me be  
If you can’t love me right, just let me be
