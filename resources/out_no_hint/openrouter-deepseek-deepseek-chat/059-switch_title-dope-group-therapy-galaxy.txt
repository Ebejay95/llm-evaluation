Dope, group therapy, galaxy  
We’re floating in the vast unknown  
Dope, group therapy, galaxy  
Our minds are seeds that we have sown  

Lost in the cosmos, searching for light  
Healing together, we’ll make it right  
Dope, group therapy, galaxy  
A journey through the stars tonight  

We’re breaking free, we’re finding peace  
In this celestial release  
Dope, group therapy, galaxy  
Our souls align, our hearts increase  

So let it flow, let it be  
In this cosmic symphony  
Dope, group therapy, galaxy  
We’re infinite, we’re wild and free
