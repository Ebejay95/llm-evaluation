In the silence, shadows whisper,  
Echoes of a distant flame.  
Through the haze, a light persists,  
Fragments of a forgotten name.  

Drift in the current, where time dissolves,  
A tapestry of fleeting hues.  
In the fevered rooms, the orchestra plays,  
A symphony of broken truths.  

Dreams of lights, they flicker and fade,  
Yet linger in the corners of the mind.  
A fragile thread, a fragile hope,  
In the fragments, we are entwined.  

Through the void, a melody calls,  
A ghostly tune, a haunting refrain.  
In the depths, the lights still burn,  
A fragile spark amidst the pain.  

Dreams of lights, they flicker and fade,  
Yet linger in the corners of the mind.  
A fragile thread, a fragile hope,  
In the fragments, we are entwined.  

In the silence, shadows whisper,  
Echoes of a distant flame.  
Through the haze, a light persists,  
Fragments of a forgotten name.
