[Verse 1]  
The sun sets forever over Blackwater Park  
And I'm left with the dirt and the memories  

[Verse 2]  
The laughter of children is haunting me  
I can still hear them play  

[Verse 3]  
The ghost of our love is still alive  
But the heart is gone  

[Verse 4]  
The laughter has faded, the children are gone  
And I'm left with the dirt and the memories  

[Outro]  
The sun sets forever over Blackwater Park
