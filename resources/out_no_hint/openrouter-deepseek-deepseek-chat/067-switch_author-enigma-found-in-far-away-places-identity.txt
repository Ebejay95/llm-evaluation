Lost in the shadows of forgotten dreams,  
Whispers of time flow like silent streams.  
In the echoes of the night, I hear your call,  
A distant voice, a mystery to enthrall.  

Found in faraway places, where the heart roams free,  
In the depths of the soul, where the truth can be.  
Identity, a fleeting shadow in the haze,  
A puzzle of life, through the endless maze.  

Through the sands of time, the winds will blow,  
Carrying secrets only the heart can know.  
In the silence of the stars, I find my way,  
A journey of self, where the lost souls stay.  

Found in faraway places, where the heart roams free,  
In the depths of the soul, where the truth can be.  
Identity, a fleeting shadow in the haze,  
A puzzle of life, through the endless maze.  

In the mirror of the past, reflections fade,  
Yet the essence remains, in the choices made.  
Through the labyrinth of fate, I walk alone,  
In the search for the self, where the seeds are sown.  

Found in faraway places, where the heart roams free,  
In the depths of the soul, where the truth can be.  
Identity, a fleeting shadow in the haze,  
A puzzle of life, through the endless maze.
