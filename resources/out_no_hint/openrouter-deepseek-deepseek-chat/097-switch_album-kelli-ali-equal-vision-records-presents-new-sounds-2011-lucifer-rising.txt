Lucifer rising, the serpent uncoils
In the garden of shadows, where the moonlight spoils
Whispers of temptation, a forbidden song
In the heart of the darkness, where the lost belong

Lucifer rising, the stars align
In the velvet night, where the spirits entwine
A dance of deception, a masquerade
In the realm of the fallen, where the dreams are laid

Lucifer rising, the fire ignites
In the depths of the soul, where the shadows take flight
A symphony of chaos, a melody of sin
In the arms of the devil, where the world begins

Lucifer rising, the veil is torn
In the silence of the night, where the new is born
A whisper of rebellion, a cry of the free
In the heart of the darkness, where the spirit will be
