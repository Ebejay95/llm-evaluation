MC1R, believe, force of inertia  
Pulling me under, I can't resist it  
MC1R, believe, force of inertia  
Dragging me deeper, I can't dismiss it  

I'd be disappointed if I cared enough  
But the weight of it all is just too much  
I'd be disappointed if I cared enough  
But the gravity's pulling, I can't get up  

MC1R, believe, force of inertia  
Holding me captive, I can't escape it  
MC1R, believe, force of inertia  
Binding me tightly, I can't shake it  

I'd be disappointed if I cared enough  
But the weight of it all is just too much  
I'd be disappointed if I cared enough  
But the gravity's pulling, I can't get up
