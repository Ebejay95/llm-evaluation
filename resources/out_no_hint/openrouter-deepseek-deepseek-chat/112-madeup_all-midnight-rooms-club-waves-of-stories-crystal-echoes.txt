Midnight rooms club, where the shadows play  
Waves of stories carry us away  
Crystal echoes in the neon haze  
Lost in the rhythm, we’re caught in the maze  

Whispers of secrets, the night unfolds  
Dreams in the corners, the darkness holds  
Every heartbeat, a tale untold  
In the midnight rooms, where we lose control  

Waves of stories, they crash and flow  
Crystal echoes, they softly glow  
In the midnight rooms, we come and go  
Chasing the magic, the afterglow  

Midnight rooms club, where the shadows play  
Waves of stories carry us away  
Crystal echoes in the neon haze  
Lost in the rhythm, we’re caught in the maze
