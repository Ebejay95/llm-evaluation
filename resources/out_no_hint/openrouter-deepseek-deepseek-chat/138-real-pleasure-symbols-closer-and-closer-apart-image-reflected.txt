Pleasure symbols, closer and closer apart  
Image reflected, a shadow in the dark  
Whispers of silence, echoes of the heart  
Fading illusions, tearing us apart  

Closer and closer, yet drifting away  
Image reflected, in the light of day  
Pleasure symbols, a fleeting embrace  
Lost in the void, a forgotten space  

Closer and closer, apart we remain  
Image reflected, a ghost in the chain  
Pleasure symbols, a bittersweet song  
In the mirror of time, where we belong
