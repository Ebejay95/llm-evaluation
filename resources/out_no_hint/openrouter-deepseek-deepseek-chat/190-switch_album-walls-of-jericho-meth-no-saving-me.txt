Walls of Jericho:
Standing tall, they won't fall
Built to last, they'll never crash
Stone by stone, they hold their own
Walls of Jericho, they'll never let go

Meth:
Speed through my veins, I can't feel the pain
Lost in the haze, I'm going insane
Chasing the high, I'm ready to fly
Meth in my system, I'm ready to die

No Saving Me:
I'm falling deep, can't find my way
Lost in the dark, I'm here to stay
No saving me, I'm too far gone
In this abyss, I'll carry on
