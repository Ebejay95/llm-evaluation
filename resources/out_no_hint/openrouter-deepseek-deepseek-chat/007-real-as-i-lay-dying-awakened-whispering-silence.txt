Whispering silence, deafening my ears
A hollow echo of all I’ve left behind
The weight of failure, the burden of regret
I’m paralyzed by the fear of what’s ahead

I’ve lost my way, I’ve lost my voice
I’ve lost the will to carry on
But in the darkness, a spark remains
A flicker of hope to guide me home

Whispering silence, speak to me
Tell me the truth I’ve been afraid to see
In the stillness, I’ll find my strength
And rise from the ashes of my defeat

The path is broken, the road is steep
But I’ll climb this mountain, I’ll face the pain
For every scar, for every tear
I’ll find the courage to start again

Whispering silence, speak to me
Tell me the truth I’ve been afraid to see
In the stillness, I’ll find my strength
And rise from the ashes of my defeat

I’ll rise, I’ll rise, I’ll rise
From the ashes of my defeat
I’ll rise, I’ll rise, I’ll rise
And find the strength to carry on

Whispering silence, speak to me
Tell me the truth I’ve been afraid to see
In the stillness, I’ll find my strength
And rise from the ashes of my defeat
