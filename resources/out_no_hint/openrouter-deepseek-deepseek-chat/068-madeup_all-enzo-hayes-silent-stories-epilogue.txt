Whispers fade into the night,  
Echoes of a silent fight.  
Shadows linger, soft and low,  
Tales of what we’ll never know.  

Footsteps trace the paths we’ve worn,  
Memories of the love we’ve torn.  
Fragments scattered, lost in time,  
A melody without a rhyme.  

Silent stories, etched in stone,  
Of hearts that beat, yet stand alone.  
The weight of words we left unsaid,  
Now lingers where our spirits bled.  

In the quiet, we find our way,  
Through the dark, to break of day.  
Though the silence cuts so deep,  
In its stillness, we find our sleep.  

Silent stories, forever told,  
In the echoes of the bold.  
A whisper, a sigh, a fleeting glance,  
In the silence, we find our chance.
