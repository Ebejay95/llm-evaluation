Windows #43, the time has come
To face the fear that's in your eyes
Windows #43, the time has come
To face the fear that's in your eyes

The mirror cracks, the image fades
The truth revealed, the masquerade
Windows #43, the time has come
To face the fear that's in your eyes

The shadows fall, the light is gone
The battle's lost, the war is won
Windows #43, the time has come
To face the fear that's in your eyes

The mirror cracks, the image fades
The truth revealed, the masquerade
Windows #43, the time has come
To face the fear that's in your eyes
