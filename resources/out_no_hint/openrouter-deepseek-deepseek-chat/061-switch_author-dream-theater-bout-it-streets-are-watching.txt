I'm walking down the street, the city's alive
The neon lights are flashing, the shadows come alive
I feel the pulse of the night, it's calling out to me
The rhythm of the city, it's setting my soul free

The streets are watching, they know my name
Every corner, every alley, it's all the same
I'm bout it, bout it, no turning back
The streets are watching, I'm on the attack

The hustle and the bustle, the chaos and the noise
The city never sleeps, it's got no time for boys
I'm chasing down my dreams, I'm running out of time
The streets are watching, and they're always on my mind

The streets are watching, they know my name
Every corner, every alley, it's all the same
I'm bout it, bout it, no turning back
The streets are watching, I'm on the attack

I see the faces in the crowd, they're all just passing by
But I can feel their eyes on me, I know they're wondering why
I'm walking down this path, I'm following my heart
The streets are watching, and they're playing their part

The streets are watching, they know my name
Every corner, every alley, it's all the same
I'm bout it, bout it, no turning back
The streets are watching, I'm on the attack

I'm bout it, bout it, no turning back
The streets are watching, I'm on the attack
I'm bout it, bout it, no turning back
The streets are watching, I'm on the attack
