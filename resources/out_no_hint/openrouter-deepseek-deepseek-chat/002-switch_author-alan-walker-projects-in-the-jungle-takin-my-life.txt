(Verse 1)  
I’m walking through the jungle, shadows in the night,  
Every step I take, I feel the fear ignite.  
Voices in my head, they’re calling out my name,  
But I keep moving forward, I won’t play their game.  

(Chorus)  
They’re takin’ my life, tryin’ to break me down,  
But I’ll rise above, I won’t stay on the ground.  
In the jungle of chaos, I’ll find my way,  
I’m takin’ back my life, I’m here to stay.  

(Verse 2)  
The trees are closing in, the darkness pulls me near,  
But I’ll fight through the pain, I’ll conquer every fear.  
The echoes of the past, they whisper in my ear,  
But I’ll silence all the doubts, I’ll make it clear.  

(Chorus)  
They’re takin’ my life, tryin’ to break me down,  
But I’ll rise above, I won’t stay on the ground.  
In the jungle of chaos, I’ll find my way,  
I’m takin’ back my life, I’m here to stay.  

(Bridge)  
Through the fire, through the rain,  
I’ll endure the heartache, I’ll bear the pain.  
In the depths of the night, I’ll find my light,  
I’ll reclaim my soul, I’ll win this fight.  

(Chorus)  
They’re takin’ my life, tryin’ to break me down,  
But I’ll rise above, I won’t stay on the ground.  
In the jungle of chaos, I’ll find my way,  
I’m takin’ back my life, I’m here to stay.  

(Outro)  
I’m walking through the jungle, stronger than before,  
The shadows can’t touch me, I’ve opened up the door.  
I’ve taken back my life, I’ve found my way,  
In the jungle of chaos, I’ll forever stay.
