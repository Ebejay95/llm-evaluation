Golden letters, carved in stone,  
Whispers of a world unknown.  
Signals of signals, echoes fade,  
In the silence, truths are made.  

Shadows dance on the edge of time,  
Secrets hidden in the rhyme.  
Golden letters, they softly gleam,  
Unveiling the fabric of the dream.  

Through the static, voices call,  
Breaking through the ancient wall.  
Signals of signals, lost and found,  
In the chaos, meaningâ€™s bound.  

Golden letters, they guide the way,  
Through the night, into the day.  
Signals of signals, forever near,  
In the whispers, we disappear.
