Blue light, blue light
Shining down on me
Blue light, blue light
What do you want from me?

I see you standing there
With your hands in the air
Like you just don't care
Like you just don't care

Blue light, blue light
Shining down on me
Blue light, blue light
What do you want from me?

I hear you calling out
But I'm filled with doubt
What's it all about?
What's it all about?

Blue light, blue light
Shining down on me
Blue light, blue light
What do you want from me?

I feel you in my soul
But I'm out of control
Can you make me whole?
Can you make me whole?

Blue light, blue light
Shining down on me
Blue light, blue light
What do you want from me?
