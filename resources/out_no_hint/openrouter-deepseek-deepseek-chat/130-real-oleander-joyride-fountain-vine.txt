Oleander, Joyride, Fountain & Vine  
Whispers of the past, they intertwine  
Memories linger, like a shadow in the night  
Chasing the echoes, holding on tight  

Oleander, blooming in the haze  
Joyride, lost in endless days  
Fountain & Vine, where the stories align  
In the heart of the city, where the stars still shine  

Footsteps fade, but the rhythm remains  
In the silence, the melody sustains  
Oleander, Joyride, Fountain & Vine  
Forever etched in the sands of time
