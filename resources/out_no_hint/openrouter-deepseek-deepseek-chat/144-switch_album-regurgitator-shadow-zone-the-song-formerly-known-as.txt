In the shadow zone, where the lost are found
A place where silence is the only sound
In the shadow zone, where the darkness grows
A place where nobody knows

In the shadow zone, where the shadows play
A place where night turns into day
In the shadow zone, where the whispers call
A place where you can lose it all

In the shadow zone, where the echoes fade
A place where memories are made
In the shadow zone, where the secrets hide
A place where you can't decide

In the shadow zone, where the shadows creep
A place where you can't sleep
In the shadow zone, where the shadows lie
A place where you can't deny

In the shadow zone, where the shadows fall
A place where you can lose it all
In the shadow zone, where the shadows stay
A place where night turns into day

In the shadow zone, where the shadows roam
A place where you can't go home
In the shadow zone, where the shadows dwell
A place where you can't tell

In the shadow zone, where the shadows meet
A place where you can't retreat
In the shadow zone, where the shadows blend
A place where you can't comprehend

In the shadow zone, where the shadows end
A place where you can't pretend
In the shadow zone, where the shadows fade
A place where memories are made
