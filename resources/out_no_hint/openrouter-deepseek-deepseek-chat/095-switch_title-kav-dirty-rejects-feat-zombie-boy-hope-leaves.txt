(Verse 1)  
I’m a ghost in the back of your mind,  
A shadow you can’t leave behind.  
Every step that you take, I’m right there,  
Whispering sins in the cold midnight air.  

(Pre-Chorus)  
You try to run, but you’re tied to the past,  
Every scar on your skin’s gonna last.  
No redemption, no light in the dark,  
Just the echo of a voice in your heart.  

(Chorus)  
Hope leaves like the dead in the night,  
No prayers left, no will to fight.  
We’re the broken, the cursed, the blind,  
Dirty rejects left behind.  

(Verse 2)  
Zombie Boy creeping under your bed,  
Nightmares woven inside of your head.  
You can scream but they’ll never hear,  
The weight of the world feeds your fear.  

(Pre-Chorus)  
You try to run, but you’re tied to the past,  
Every scar on your skin’s gonna last.  
No redemption, no light in the dark,  
Just the echo of a voice in your heart.  

(Chorus)  
Hope leaves like the dead in the night,  
No prayers left, no will to fight.  
We’re the broken, the cursed, the blind,  
Dirty rejects left behind.  

(Bridge)  
Bury me shallow, let the wolves dig me out,  
I’m the ghost of the life you forgot about.  
No flowers, no tears when I’m gone,  
Just the hum of a dead man’s song.  

(Chorus)  
Hope leaves like the dead in the night,  
No prayers left, no will to fight.  
We’re the broken, the cursed, the blind,  
Dirty rejects left behind.  

(Outro)  
Left behind…  
Left behind…  
Left behind…
