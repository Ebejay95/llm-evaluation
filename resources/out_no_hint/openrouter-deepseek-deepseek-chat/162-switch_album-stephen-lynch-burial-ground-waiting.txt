I'm waiting for the bus
I'm waiting for the train
I'm waiting for my life to start again
I'm waiting for a sign
I'm waiting for a change
I'm waiting for the sun to shine again
I'm waiting for the phone to ring
I'm waiting for the mail to come
I'm waiting for the world to end
I'm waiting for the day I'm done
I'm waiting for the stars to align
I'm waiting for the perfect time
I'm waiting for the moment when
I'll finally be alive again
I'm waiting for the bus
I'm waiting for the train
I'm waiting for my life to start again
