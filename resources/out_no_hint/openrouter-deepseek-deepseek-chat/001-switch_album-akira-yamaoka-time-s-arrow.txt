Time's arrow marches forward, never looking back
A relentless force, a one-way track
Moments slip away, like sand through our hands
A fleeting dance, where nothing stands

The past is a shadow, the future a dream
The present a whisper, a fragile stream
We chase the horizon, but it fades from view
Time's arrow flies, and we must follow too

Each tick of the clock, a step into the unknown
A path we walk, but never own
Memories linger, but they start to fade
Time's arrow cuts, and the price is paid

The past is a shadow, the future a dream
The present a whisper, a fragile stream
We chase the horizon, but it fades from view
Time's arrow flies, and we must follow too

No turning back, no second chance
Time's arrow moves in a steady dance
Embrace the now, before it's gone
For time's arrow marches on and on

The past is a shadow, the future a dream
The present a whisper, a fragile stream
We chase the horizon, but it fades from view
Time's arrow flies, and we must follow too
