Slices of you, slices of me
Slices of everything we see
Slices of love, slices of hate
Slices of everything we create

Slices of time, slices of space
Slices of everything we chase
Slices of joy, slices of pain
Slices of everything we contain

Switzerland, Switzerland
Neutral ground, where we stand
Switzerland, Switzerland
Slicing through, hand in hand

Slices of truth, slices of lies
Slices of everything we disguise
Slices of hope, slices of fear
Slices of everything we hold dear

Switzerland, Switzerland
Neutral ground, where we stand
Switzerland, Switzerland
Slicing through, hand in hand

Slices of you, slices of me
Slices of everything we see
Slices of love, slices of hate
Slices of everything we create

Switzerland, Switzerland
Neutral ground, where we stand
Switzerland, Switzerland
Slicing through, hand in hand
