Fading horizons call my name
Velvet patterns in the rain
Green light whispers through the haze
Lost in time, we drift away

Shadows dance on silent streets
Echoes of our heartbeats meet
In the stillness, we find peace
Moments linger, never cease

Colors blend, the world turns slow
Dreams collide, emotions flow
In the silence, we are whole
Fading horizons, take us home

Velvet patterns, soft and deep
Green light guides where shadows sleep
In the night, our souls will keep
Fading horizons, endless sleep
