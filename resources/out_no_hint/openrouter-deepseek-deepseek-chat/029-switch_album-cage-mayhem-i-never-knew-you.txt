I never knew you, no, I never knew you  
You were always there but I never saw through  
The mask you wore, the lies you told  
Now the truth is cold and the story’s old  

I never knew you, no, I never knew you  
Thought we were tight but the bond was loose  
Now the walls close in, the shadows grow  
And the love we had just turned to smoke  

I never knew you, no, I never knew you  
All the words you said were just passing through  
Now the silence screams, the echoes fade  
And I’m left here with the mess you made  

I never knew you, no, I never knew you  
Guess the heart don’t lie but the eyes refuse  
To see the cracks beneath the paint  
Now the picture’s gone, just a ghost remains
