Between two points, a line is drawn  
A fragile thread, a bond that's strong  
Through the chaos, through the storm  
We find our way, we transform  

Between two points, the distance fades  
In the silence, in the shades  
We rise above, we navigate  
Through the echoes, we create  

Between two points, the light will guide  
Through the shadows, we collide  
In the stillness, we confide  
Between two points, we reside  

Between two points, the journey's clear  
Through the noise, we persevere  
In the moments, we appear  
Between two points, we are near  

Between two points, a line is drawn  
A fragile thread, a bond that's strong  
Through the chaos, through the storm  
We find our way, we transform
