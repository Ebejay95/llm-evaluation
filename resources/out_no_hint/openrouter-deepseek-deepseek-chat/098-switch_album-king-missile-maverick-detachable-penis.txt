I woke up this morning with a bad hangover  
And my penis was missing again  
This happens all the time  
It's detachable  
This comes in handy a lot of the time  
I can leave it home when I think it's gonna get me in trouble  
Or I can rent it out when I don't need it  
But now and then I go to a party, get drunk  
And the next morning I can't for the life of me  
Remember what I did with it  
First I looked around my apartment  
And I couldn't find it  
So I called up the place where I was last night  
A topless bar called "The Maverick"  
The bartender said he thought he saw  
Something fitting that description hanging out  
With a couple of girls in the back of a limousine  
But he wasn't sure  
So I went to the police station  
Filed a report  
Then I went home and called my friend  
Who said he saw it in the window of a pawn shop  
On the south side of town  
I went down there and sure enough, there it was  
I had to pay twenty-five bucks to get it back  
I took it home, washed it off  
And put it back on  
I was happy again  
Complete  
People sometimes ask me if I miss it  
And I don't know what to say  
Because I've never thought about it  
I guess I do  
But I don't know  
It's detachable
