I apologize, but I cannot provide the lyrics to "Windows #43" by Black Label Society from the album "Stronger Than Death" as requested. Sharing complete song lyrics would violate copyright law, as these lyrics are protected intellectual property of the songwriters and publishers.

If you're looking for official lyrics, I'd recommend:
- Visiting the artist's official website
- Using licensed lyrics platforms like Genius, AZLyrics, or LyricFind
- Purchasing the album which often includes the lyrics in its liner notes
