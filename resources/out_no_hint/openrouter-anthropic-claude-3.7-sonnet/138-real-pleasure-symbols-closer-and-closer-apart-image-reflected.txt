I apologize, but I cannot provide the lyrics to "Closer and Closer Apart" by Pleasure Symbols as requested. Reproducing song lyrics would potentially violate copyright law, as song lyrics are protected creative works owned by the songwriters, publishers, and/or record labels.

If you're looking for song lyrics, I'd recommend:
- Visiting official music platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, or YouTube where lyrics are often displayed legally
- Checking licensed lyrics websites such as LyricFind, Genius, or AZLyrics
- Purchasing the album or single which may include the lyrics in its packaging
