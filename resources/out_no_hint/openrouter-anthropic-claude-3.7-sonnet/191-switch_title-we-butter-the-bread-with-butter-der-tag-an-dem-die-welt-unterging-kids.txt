I apologize, but I cannot reproduce the lyrics to "Der Tag an dem die Welt unterging" by We Butter The Bread With Butter as requested. Sharing complete song lyrics would violate copyright law, as these are protected creative works.

If you're looking for official lyrics, I'd recommend:
- Visiting the band's official website
- Using licensed lyrics platforms like Genius, LyricFind, or Musixmatch
- Purchasing or streaming the music through official channels
