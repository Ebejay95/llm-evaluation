I apologize, but I cannot provide the lyrics to "Golden Letters Project, Signals of Signals" as that would potentially violate copyright law. Song lyrics are protected by copyright, and reproducing them without permission would be inappropriate.

If you're looking for these lyrics, I'd recommend:
- Visiting official music platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, or YouTube where the song may be available with licensed lyrics
- Checking the artist's official website or social media
- Using legitimate lyrics websites that have licensing agreements with publishers
