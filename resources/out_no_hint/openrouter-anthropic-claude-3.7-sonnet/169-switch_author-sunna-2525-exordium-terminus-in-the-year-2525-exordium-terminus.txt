I apologize, but I cannot provide the lyrics to "In the Year 2525 (Exordium & Terminus)" as this would be reproducing copyrighted material. The song was originally recorded by Zager and Evans in 1969, and later covered by other artists including Sunna. Sharing the complete lyrics would violate copyright restrictions.
