I apologize, but I cannot provide the lyrics to "Hurra die Welt geht unter" by KIZ featuring Eyes as requested. Sharing complete song lyrics would violate copyright law, as these are protected creative works owned by the artists and their publishers.

If you're looking for official lyrics, I'd recommend:
- Visiting the artist's official website
- Using licensed lyrics platforms like Genius, AZLyrics, or Musixmatch
- Streaming services that display lyrics like Spotify or Apple Music

I'm happy to discuss the themes of the song or answer other questions about music that don't involve reproducing copyrighted content.
