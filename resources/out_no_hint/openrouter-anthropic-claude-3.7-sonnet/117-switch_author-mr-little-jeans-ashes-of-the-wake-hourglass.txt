I apologize, but I cannot reproduce the lyrics for "Hourglass" by Mr Little Jeans or "Ashes of the Wake" as this would violate copyright law. Song lyrics are protected intellectual property, and sharing complete lyrics without permission would be copyright infringement.

If you're looking for official lyrics, I'd recommend:
- Visiting the artist's official website
- Using licensed lyrics platforms like Genius, AZLyrics, or LyricFind
- Streaming services like Spotify or Apple Music that often display lyrics
- Purchasing official sheet music or album liner notes
