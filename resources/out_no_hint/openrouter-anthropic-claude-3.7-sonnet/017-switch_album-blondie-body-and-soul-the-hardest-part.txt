I apologize, but I cannot provide the lyrics to "The Hardest Part" by Blondie from their album "The Hunter" as this would be reproducing copyrighted material. Song lyrics are protected by copyright law, and sharing complete lyrics without permission would infringe on those rights.

If you're looking for song lyrics, I'd recommend checking official sources such as:
- The artist's official website
- Licensed lyrics websites like LyricFind
- Music streaming platforms that display licensed lyrics
- Purchasing the album which often includes the lyrics in the liner notes
