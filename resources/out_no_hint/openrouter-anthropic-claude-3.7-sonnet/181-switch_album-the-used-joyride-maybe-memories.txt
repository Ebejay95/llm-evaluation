I apologize, but I cannot provide the lyrics to "Joyride" by The Used from the album "Maybe Memories" as requested. Sharing complete song lyrics would violate copyright law, as these lyrics are protected intellectual property owned by the artists, songwriters, and their publishers.

If you're looking for official lyrics, I'd recommend:
- Visiting the artist's official website
- Using licensed lyrics platforms like Genius, AZLyrics, or LyricFind
- Streaming services that display lyrics like Spotify or Apple Music
- Purchasing the official album which may contain the lyrics in its liner notes
