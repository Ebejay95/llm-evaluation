I apologize, but I cannot provide the lyrics to "Patterns #84" from Lunar Aurora's album "Hoagascht" as that would be reproducing copyrighted material. Song lyrics are protected by copyright law, and sharing them without permission would be inappropriate.

If you're interested in the lyrics, I would recommend:
- Checking the official album booklet
- Visiting the band's official website
- Using legal lyrics databases like LyricFind or Musixmatch
- Streaming services that display licensed lyrics
