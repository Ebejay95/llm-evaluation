I apologize, but I cannot reproduce the lyrics to "White Light" by Stick To Your Guns from "The Hope Division" album, as doing so would violate copyright law. Song lyrics are protected intellectual property, and sharing complete lyrics without permission would be copyright infringement.

If you're looking for these lyrics, I'd recommend:
- Visiting official lyric sites like Genius.com or AZLyrics
- Checking the band's official website or social media
- Streaming services often display lyrics while playing songs
- The physical album or digital booklet may contain the official lyrics
