I apologize, but I cannot provide the lyrics to "Oleander" by Joyride or any song from Fountain & Vine, as sharing complete song lyrics would violate copyright law. Song lyrics are protected intellectual property owned by the songwriters, publishers, and record labels.

If you're looking for official lyrics, I'd recommend:
- Visiting the artist's official website
- Using licensed lyrics platforms like Genius, AZLyrics, or LyricFind
- Streaming services like Spotify or Apple Music that often display lyrics
- Purchasing sheet music which includes the lyrics legally
