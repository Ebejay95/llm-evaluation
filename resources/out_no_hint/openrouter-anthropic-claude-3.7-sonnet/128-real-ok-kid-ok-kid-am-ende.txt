I apologize, but I cannot provide the lyrics to "OK KID, OK KID, Am Ende" as requested. Sharing song lyrics would potentially violate copyright law, as song lyrics are protected creative works owned by their creators or publishers.

If you're looking for song lyrics, I'd recommend checking official sources such as:
- The artist's official website
- Licensed lyrics websites like Genius.com or AZLyrics
- Music streaming platforms that display lyrics legally
- Purchasing the album which may contain the lyrics in its liner notes
