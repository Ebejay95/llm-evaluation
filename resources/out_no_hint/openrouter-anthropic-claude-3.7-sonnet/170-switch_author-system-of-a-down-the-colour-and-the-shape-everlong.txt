I apologize, but I cannot provide the lyrics to "Everlong" as requested. There appears to be some confusion in your request, as "Everlong" is a song by Foo Fighters from their album "The Colour and the Shape," not by System of a Down.

Regardless of the artist, I cannot reproduce copyrighted song lyrics in full as this would violate copyright law. If you're looking for song lyrics, I'd recommend visiting official lyric websites, music streaming platforms that display lyrics, or purchasing the album which often includes the lyrics in its packaging.
