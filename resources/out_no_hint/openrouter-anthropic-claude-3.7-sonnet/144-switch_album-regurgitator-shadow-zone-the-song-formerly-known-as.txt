I apologize, but I cannot reproduce the lyrics to "The Song Formerly Known As" by Regurgitator from their album "Shadow Zone" as this would be a copyright violation. Song lyrics are protected by copyright law, and sharing the complete lyrics without permission would infringe on the rights of the songwriters and publishers.

If you're looking for these lyrics, I'd recommend checking official lyrics websites that have licensing agreements with publishers, the artist's official website, or music streaming platforms that often display lyrics legally.
