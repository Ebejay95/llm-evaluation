I apologize, but I cannot provide the lyrics to "Enigma" by August Burns Red from their album "Found In Far Away Places" or any song titled "Identity" that might be related. Reproducing song lyrics would violate copyright law, as lyrics are protected creative works.

If you're looking for song lyrics, I recommend:
- Visiting official artist websites
- Using licensed lyrics platforms like Genius, AZLyrics, or Musixmatch
- Streaming services that display lyrics (Spotify, Apple Music)

These sources have proper licensing agreements to legally share lyrics.
