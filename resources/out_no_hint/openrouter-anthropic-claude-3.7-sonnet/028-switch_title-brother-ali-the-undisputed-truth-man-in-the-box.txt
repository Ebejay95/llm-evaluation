I apologize, but I cannot provide the lyrics to "Man in the Box" by Brother Ali from the album "The Undisputed Truth" as that would be reproducing copyrighted material. Song lyrics are protected by copyright law, and sharing complete lyrics without permission would be a copyright violation.

If you're interested in the lyrics, I'd recommend:
- Checking official music platforms like Spotify or Apple Music where lyrics are often displayed legally
- Visiting Brother Ali's official website or social media
- Using licensed lyrics websites that have agreements with publishers
