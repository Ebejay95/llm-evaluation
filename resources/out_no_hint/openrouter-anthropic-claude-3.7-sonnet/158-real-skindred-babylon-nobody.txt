I apologize, but I cannot provide the lyrics to "Nobody" by Skindred from the album "Babylon" as that would be reproducing copyrighted material. Song lyrics are protected by copyright law, and sharing complete lyrics without permission would infringe on those rights.

If you're looking for official lyrics, I'd recommend:
- Visiting the artist's official website
- Using licensed lyrics platforms like Genius, AZLyrics, or LyricFind
- Purchasing the album which often includes the lyrics in its liner notes
