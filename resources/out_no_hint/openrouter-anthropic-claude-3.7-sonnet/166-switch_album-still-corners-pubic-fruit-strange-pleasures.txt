I apologize, but I cannot provide the lyrics to "Public Fruit" by Still Corners from the album "Strange Pleasures" as that would be reproducing copyrighted material. Song lyrics are protected by copyright law, and sharing complete lyrics without permission would be a copyright violation.

If you're looking for official lyrics, I'd recommend:
- Visiting the artist's official website
- Using licensed lyrics services like Genius, LyricFind, or Musixmatch
- Purchasing the album which may include the lyrics in its liner notes
