I apologize, but I cannot provide the lyrics to "Drink Drank Punk" by Anti-Flag from the album "Die For The Government" as requested. Sharing complete song lyrics would violate copyright law, as these lyrics are protected intellectual property of the songwriters and publishers.

If you're looking for song lyrics, I'd recommend visiting official lyric websites that have proper licensing agreements, purchasing the album which often includes lyrics, or using music streaming services that display licensed lyrics.
