I apologize, but I cannot provide the lyrics to "I Don't Understand" by Jon Lajoie from the album "You Want Some of This" as that would be reproducing copyrighted material. Song lyrics are protected by copyright law, and sharing them without permission would be inappropriate.

If you're looking for song lyrics, I'd recommend checking official music platforms, the artist's official website, or licensed lyrics websites that have agreements with publishers to legally display this content.
