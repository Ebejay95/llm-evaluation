I apologize, but I cannot reproduce the lyrics for the songs "Curve," "In Schwarz," or "Falling Free" as requested. Sharing complete song lyrics would violate copyright laws, as song lyrics are protected intellectual property of the songwriters, publishers, and record labels.

If you're looking for song lyrics, I'd recommend:
- Visiting official artist websites
- Using licensed lyrics platforms like Genius, AZLyrics, or MetroLyrics
- Streaming services like Spotify or Apple Music that often display lyrics
- Purchasing official sheet music or albums

Is there something else I can help you with today?
