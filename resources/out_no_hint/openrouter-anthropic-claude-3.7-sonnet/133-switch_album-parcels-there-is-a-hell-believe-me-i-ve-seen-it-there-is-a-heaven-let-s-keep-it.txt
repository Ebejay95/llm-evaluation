I apologize, but I cannot provide the lyrics to "Myenemy" by Parcels or any song from Bring Me The Horizon's album "There Is a Hell Believe Me I've Seen It. There Is a Heaven Let's Keep It a Secret" as requested. Sharing complete song lyrics would violate copyright law.

If you're looking for song lyrics, I recommend visiting official music platforms, licensed lyrics websites like Genius or AZLyrics, or purchasing/streaming the music through authorized services.
