I apologize, but I cannot reproduce the lyrics to "Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life" as they are copyrighted material. The song was written by Eric Idle for the 1979 Monty Python film "Life of Brian" and has become one of their most recognizable works.

If you're looking for these lyrics, I'd recommend checking official lyric websites, streaming services that display lyrics, or purchasing the official sheet music.
