I notice you're asking about song lyrics for "Boulevard of Broken Dreams." I can't reproduce copyrighted song lyrics in full, as that would violate copyright law. 

"Boulevard of Broken Dreams" is a well-known song by Green Day (not The xx) from their 2004 album "American Idiot." If you're looking for the official lyrics, I'd recommend checking licensed lyrics websites, music streaming platforms, or purchasing the official sheet music.
