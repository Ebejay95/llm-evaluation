I apologize, but I cannot provide the lyrics to "Atonement" by Opeth from the album "Ghost Reveries" as requested. Song lyrics are protected by copyright, and reproducing them without permission would be a copyright violation.

If you're interested in the lyrics, I would recommend:
- Checking official music platforms like Spotify or Apple Music where lyrics are often displayed legally
- Visiting the band's official website or social media
- Looking at legally licensed lyrics websites that have agreements with publishers
