I apologize, but I cannot provide the lyrics to "Black & White" by Seahaven from their album "TRUNK THERAPY" as requested. Sharing complete song lyrics would violate copyright laws, as these are protected creative works owned by the artists and their publishers.

If you're looking for official lyrics, I'd recommend:
- Visiting the artist's official website
- Using licensed lyrics platforms like Genius, LyricFind, or Musixmatch
- Purchasing the album which may include the lyrics in its liner notes
