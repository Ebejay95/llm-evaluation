I cannot provide the lyrics to "No Relief" by Defeater from the album "Letters Home" as that would be reproducing copyrighted material. Song lyrics are protected by copyright law, and sharing the complete lyrics without permission would be a copyright violation.

If you're looking for these lyrics, I'd recommend checking official sources like the band's official website, official lyric sites with licensing agreements, or purchasing/streaming the album through legitimate platforms.
