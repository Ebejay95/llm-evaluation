I apologize, but I cannot provide the lyrics to "Willows" by Hundredth from the album "When Will We Surrender" as that would be reproducing copyrighted material. Song lyrics are protected by copyright law, and sharing complete lyrics without permission would infringe on those rights.

If you're looking for official lyrics, I'd recommend checking licensed lyrics websites like Genius, AZLyrics, or the artist's official website, or streaming services that have licensed lyrics features.
