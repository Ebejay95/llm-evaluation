It starts with one thing
I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time

I know I made it so complicated for everyone to understand
All your carefulness and kindness
Everything that you have had to endure
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how
I tried so hard

In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so

Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me
In the end
You kept everything inside and
Even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually
Be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
