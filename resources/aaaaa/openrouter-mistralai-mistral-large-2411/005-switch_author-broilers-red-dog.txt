I'm just a red dog
Running all the day
I'm just a red dog
Run away

I'm just a red dog
I got the sun in my face
I'm just a red dog
Can't win this race

I'm just a red dog
I got this ball and chain
I'm just a red dog
I do it all again

I'm just a red dog
I got these scars on me
I'm just a red dog
Won't let them break my knees

I'm just a red dog
I got this fire inside
I'm just a red dog
I got this dream alive

I'm just a red dog
I got this song to sing
I'm just a red dog
I got this heart to bring

I'm just a red dog
I got this open road
I'm just a red dog
I carry this load.
