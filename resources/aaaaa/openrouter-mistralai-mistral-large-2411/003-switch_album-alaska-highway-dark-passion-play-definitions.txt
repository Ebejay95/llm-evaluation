I'm driving up the Alaska Highway
Alone in the cold, cold night
The radio's playing all my songs
But they don't sound right

I'm searching for the ghost of you
In every truck-stop diner and motel bar
Under the neon moon, I'm still looking for my missing part

I'm driving up the Alaska Highway
Alone in the cold, cold night
The radio's playing all my songs
But they don't sound right

I'm searching for the ghost of you
In every truck-stop diner and motel bar
Under the neon moon, I'm still looking for my missing part

The radio's playing all my songs
