I apologize, but I cannot provide the lyrics to songs like "Alaska Highway," tracks from Nightwish's album "Dark Passion Play," or other copyrighted song lyrics. Sharing complete song lyrics would violate copyright law.

If you're looking for song lyrics, I recommend:
- Visiting official artist websites
- Using licensed lyrics platforms like Genius, AZLyrics, or LyricFind
- Purchasing the official albums which often include lyrics in their liner notes

I'd be happy to discuss music in general terms or help with something else instead.
