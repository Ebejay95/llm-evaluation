I've tried so many times
But I'm still just a stranger
I've talked to God, and I'm back on my feet
You're the reason I believe

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all the times that I've been broken
I just want you to know

In the end
I will remember you
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all the times that I've been broken
I just want you to know

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all the times that I've been broken
I just want you to know

In the end
I will remember you
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all the times that I've been broken
I just want you to know

In the end
I will remember you
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all the times that I've been broken
I just want you to know

In the end
I will remember you
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all the times that I've been broken
I just want you to know

In the end
I will remember you
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all the times that I've been broken
I just want you to know
