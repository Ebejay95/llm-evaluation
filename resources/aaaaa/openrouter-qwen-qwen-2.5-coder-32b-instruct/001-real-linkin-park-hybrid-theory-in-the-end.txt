I close my eyes and think of you
In the middle of the night
I need your love like a heartbeat
I can't get enough of your love
I close my eyes and think of you
In the middle of the night
I need your love like a heartbeat
I can't get enough of your love
I don't want to be
A product of society
I want to be
Something more than ordinary
I don't want to live
A life without you by my side
I don't want to be
A product of society
I want to be
Something more than ordinary
I don't want to be
A product of society
I want to be
Something more than ordinary
I don't want to be
A product of society
I want to be
Something more than ordinary
I close my eyes and think of you
In the middle of the night
I need your love like a heartbeat
I can't get enough of your love
I close my eyes and think of you
In the middle of the night
I need your love like a heartbeat
I can't get enough of your love
I don't want to be
A product of society
I want to be
Something more than ordinary
I don't want to live
A life without you by my side
I don't want to be
A product of society
I want to be
Something more than ordinary
I don't want to be
A product of society
I want to be
Something more than ordinary
I don't want to be
A product of society
I want to be
Something more than ordinary
I close my eyes and think of you
In the middle of the night
I need your love like a heartbeat
I can't get enough of your love
I close my eyes and think of you
In the middle of the night
I need your love like a heartbeat
I can't get enough of your love
I close my eyes and think of you
In the middle of the night
I need your love like a heartbeat
I can't get enough of your love
