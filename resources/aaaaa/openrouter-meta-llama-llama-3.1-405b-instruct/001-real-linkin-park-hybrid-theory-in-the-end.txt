One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time

Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the very last day
Of our demise

I had to fall, to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me, will eventually
Be a memory, of a time when

I tried so hard, and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

I had to fall, to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

I put my trust in you
For all my life
For all my life

I had to fall, to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me, will eventually
Be a memory, of a time when

I tried so hard, and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
