The city lights are burning bright
But something's calling from the night
A restless feeling in my soul
It's time for me to rock'n'roll

I'm a Red Dog, howling at the moon
I'm a Red Dog, I'll be coming soon
I'm a Red Dog, and I'm on my way
I'm a Red Dog, and I'm here to stay

I've been walking down the lonely street
Where dreams and desperation meet
But now I'm ready to break free
And live my life the way it should be

I'm a Red Dog, howling at the moon
I'm a Red Dog, I'll be coming soon
I'm a Red Dog, and I'm on my way
I'm a Red Dog, and I'm here to stay

I've got a fire burning deep inside
A passion that I can't hide
I'll keep on fighting through the night
Until I reach the morning light

I'm a Red Dog, howling at the moon
I'm a Red Dog, I'll be coming soon
I'm a Red Dog, and I'm on my way
I'm a Red Dog, and I'm here to stay

I'm a Red Dog, howling at the moon
I'm a Red Dog, I'll be coming soon
I'm a Red Dog, and I'm on my way
I'm a Red Dog, and I'm here to stay
