Alaska Highway
I'm driving down the highway
To a place I've never been
I'm looking for a sign
To tell me where I'm going
But all I see is the endless road
And the endless sky
I'm searching for a map
To guide me through the night
But all I find is the darkness
And the endless road

Dark Passion Play
In the dark passion play
We're all just players
In a game we can't control
Our hearts beat fast
As we dance in the shadows
Of a world we can't escape

Definitions
Words have meanings
But sometimes they're just empty shells
Love, hate, joy, sorrow
Are they real or just illusions?
We search for answers
But they're always out of reach
In this endless cycle
Of life and death, right and wrong
