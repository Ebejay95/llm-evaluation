I am undone  
I am a fool  
And everything that I’ve kept down  
Is now rising up against you  

And I am tired  
So tired  
Of holding on to this  
And I am weak  
So weak  
But I’m giving in  

And all the things that I’ve held back  
Are now rising up against me  
And all the things that I’ve held back  
Are now rising up against me  

And I am tired  
So tired  
Of holding on to this  
And I am weak  
So weak  
But I’m giving in  

And all the things that I’ve held back  
Are now rising up against me  
And all the things that I’ve held back  
Are now rising up against me
