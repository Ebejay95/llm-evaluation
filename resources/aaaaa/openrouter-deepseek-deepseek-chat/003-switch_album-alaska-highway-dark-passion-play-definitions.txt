Alaska Highway:  
"Alaska Highway, take me home  
Through the wilderness, I roam  
Alaska Highway, guide my way  
Through the night and through the day"  

Dark Passion Play:  
"Dark passion play, shadows in the night  
A symphony of sorrow, lost in the fight  
Dark passion play, echoes in the void  
A tale of love and pain, forever deployed"  

Definitions:  
"Definitions, words we try to find  
Meanings lost in the corners of our mind  
Definitions, lines we draw in sand  
Shifting shapes in the palm of our hand"
