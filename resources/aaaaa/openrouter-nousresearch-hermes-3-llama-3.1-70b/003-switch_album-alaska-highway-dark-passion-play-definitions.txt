[Alaska Highway]
The highway is a long and lonely place
Where the wind don't blow and the snow don't fall
It's just a stretch of nothing in the world
But it's the only road to where I want to go

I'm driving down the Alaska Highway
I'm driving down the Alaska Highway
I'm driving down the Alaska Highway
With the windows down and the radio on

The miles are many and the towns are few
And the road goes on forever like it's trying to
But I'm not looking for a destination
I'm just trying to find a way to pass the time

I'm driving down the Alaska Highway
I'm driving down the Alaska Highway
I'm driving down the Alaska Highway
With the windows down and the radio on

[Dark Passion Play]
This is where the wild things are
Dreams come to life
This is where the heart takes flight
Dark passion play

The night is full of stars so bright
They guide me through the night
I walk the path of no return
To face the dark passion play

This is where the wild things are
Dreams come to life
This is where the heart takes flight
Dark passion play

[Definitions]
I'm searching for the words
To describe the way I feel
But every explanation
Just seems to make it real

I'm looking for definitions
Of what it's like to be alive
But every time I think I've found it
It just slips through my hands and flies

I'm searching for the words
To describe the way I feel
But every explanation
Just seems to make it real

I'm looking for definitions
Of what it's like to be alive
But every time I think I've found it
It just slips through my hands and flies
