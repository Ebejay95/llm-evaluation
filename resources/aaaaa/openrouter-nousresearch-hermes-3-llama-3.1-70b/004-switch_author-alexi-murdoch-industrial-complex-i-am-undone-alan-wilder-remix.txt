Here are the lyrics for Alexi Murdoch's song "Industrial Complex" (I Am Undone) [Alan Wilder Remix]:

I am undone, I am undone
I am undone, I am undone

In the industrial complex
In the industrial complex
In the industrial complex
In the industrial complex

I am undone, I am undone
I am undone, I am undone

In the industrial complex
In the industrial complex
In the industrial complex
In the industrial complex

I am undone, I am undone
I am undone, I am undone

In the industrial complex
In the industrial complex
In the industrial complex
In the industrial complex

I am undone, I am undone
I am undone, I am undone

In the industrial complex
In the industrial complex
In the industrial complex
In the industrial complex

I am undone, I am undone
I am undone, I am undone

In the industrial complex
In the industrial complex
In the industrial complex
In the industrial complex

I am undone, I am undone
I am undone, I am undone

In the industrial complex
In the industrial complex
In the industrial complex

I am undone, I am undone
I am undone, I am undone

In the industrial complex
In the industrial complex
