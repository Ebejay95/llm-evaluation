Here is the lyrics text for "In the End" by Linkin Park from the album Hybrid Theory:

It starts with one thing I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time

(Chorus)
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

It starts with one thing I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time

(Chorus)

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

(Chorus)

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

(Chorus)
